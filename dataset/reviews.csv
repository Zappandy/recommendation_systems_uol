Try the entirety of our consumer society. Who the heck needs a thneed anyway? It's a pointless product. But: ""You poor, stupid, guy. You never can tell what some people will buy!"" When the Lorax tells the Onceler that the plants and animals are dying? 'Now you listen here, Dad! ... Business is business and business must grow!"" It sounded like the U.S. Army Generals 'explaining' to the Sioux or the Cheyenne that they need to get out of the way of ""progress."" (See, e.g., ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee""). 
 It should also be noted that the Lorax is based on a character from a Russian fables, a man who comes out of the stump of a tree, and has an affinity with nature (found in Joseph Campbell)."

He tries playing all sorts of things--pirates, cards, soccer--but the wind always ruins the fun. Eventually he goes home to pout. His mama encourages him to think out how he can play with the wind instead of against it. The little fox then thinks about flying kites! He makes kites for himself and all of his friends to enjoy on windy days. 
 Good for preschool storytimes."

This is its companion book (close companion), an A to Z of naughty children. The illustrations are fun, as are most of the poems, as long as you emphasize to your impressionable children (because mine are not impressionable, no, not at all) that this book represents the obnoxious sort."

For gifted learners, especially those who struggle with anxiety, this is a common thought. But Scaredy Squirrel once again proves to use that sometimes that best laid plans may go awry. And when they do, things can still turn out alright. In fact, sometimes, the end result is even better than what we originally hoped for. 
 There are several Scaredy Squirrel books and I love all of them. The illustrations, which include maps and labeled graphics, always make me laugh. Melanie Watt does a fabulous job of adding humor to the serious topic of anxiety, providing us with great books we can share with our children and students to help them work through their worries and fears."

John Smith, the Jamestown settlement, her kidnapping, marriage to John Rolfe, birth of her son and trip to London are all included. 
 This is a rather rosy telling. Sensitive children are spared knowledge of her death at the age of 22 (this was confusing and unsettling for our students that knew ""the rest of the story""), the death of her son, and her complicate relationship with John Smith. 
 An enjoyable read that needs some supplemental source material. Recommended."

The characters seem wooden and the ""plot"", such as it is, forced. The information presented does enhance understanding of the Biblical account, and perhaps that is why people like them? It is true the theology and respect for the Scriptures are here, but unpalatable. I would rather simply read the Biblical account to my children and answer their questions. Not recommended.

What he did for the math community is huge. I also really like they way the math symbols are incorporated into the story in a effective way.

Suitable for older readers and adults alike, this is the story of Sasha, a 12 year old girl who has been traumatised by constant moves and an unsettled upbringing.

 When she meets Meteor, a horse troubled by his own mixed past, she must overcome her own fears and learn to trust again.

The children act like robots and the prefects are hopped up on their own power and think nothing of doling out cruel and unusual punishments for the slightest infraction. But the headmaster - he's the really disturbing thing... 
 I read this in Year 7 or Year 8, along with my class, and I just barely remembered it, so it was interesting to read it again. 
 I can't exactly say I liked the book. I can't say I disliked it either. For pure enjoyment, it was not to my taste: I found it quite cold and joyless. Yet Ms Cross has definitely captured the sense of alienation that so many pre-teens and early teenagers feel, that sense that they are alone and persecuted and that adults who should be helpful are blind and deaf at best and evil at worst. Dinah, who is truly alone in the world, and the Hunter brothers, who are outcasts at school and whose otherwise loving parents refuse to believe the atrocities that are being committed by the headmaster, are characters whose problems will have touched a nerve in a lot of kids, from the time the book was written right through today. 
 So not to my personal taste, and probably not interesting enough for me to look up the sequels, but a good read nonetheless. 3 - 3.5 stars."

 John Henry is a mythical American (perhaps loosely based on a real person) more children should learn about, so I'm pleased to see a few of his stories being retold in this volume: his birth and prodigious growth, building a road, and hammering through a mountain. I was less enthused with the odd insertion of modern touches--a swimming pool and Jacuzzi added to the house--into a story dating to the late 1800s. Still, it's an enjoyable read with fun metaphors and similes, interesting stories, a likable character, and attractive artwork. 
 Note: John Henry is an admirable hero, and children may be distressed when he dies. Use your judgment with sensitive children. However, the book handles it well, and it could be a teaching moment with meaningful discussion with the right children."

His only refuge is shop class, where he discovers he has a natural ability with woodworking. Unfortunately, his foster mother, Ms. Mabel, forbids him from being in shop class -- something about it being 'too dangerous'. The shop teacher, Mr. Strick, hears about a carpentry contest and enters Flea against his foster mother's wishes. 
 But the contest is televised. After the carpentry competition, Flea starts imagining that the snowmen in his neighborhood are looking at him. On Christmas Eve, he's whisked away to the North Pole, and finds that he is actually one of Santa's Elves. Even though he's a natural woodworker, Flea is nowhere close to elf standards, and has to prove his ability to be able to join the elf elite. 
 What I liked about this book: 
 I *really* enjoyed this story. Flea is a nice kid trying to find a way to navigate junior high, and finds some of the same problems of fitting in when he has to attend the North Pole's elf school. He tries to stick to the high ground and be good to other people, forming solid friendships along the way. 
 I loved the premise, and cracked up that the elf kid was good in shop class. The North Pole was beautifully described, and I liked the explanation for Santa's magic through the story. 
 What I didn't like about this book: 
 I wanted a few more answers about who Flea really is. It's established that Flea is the main character's nickname, but his actually name is never given. He's a foster kid, so there's some question about who his parents are, which is touched on but readers are left with more questions than answers. 
 One of the subplots is that the South Pole is attacking the North Pole. I wanted a little more explanation in that department, too. It was never quite clear why there was a threat to the North Pole to begin with. 
 However, the book was left open ended for a sequel (which I will of course be checking out!) 
 Final Verdict: 
 One of the best MG stories I've read this year. This is a solid 4.5 star book (too good to round down to 4 stars, so I'm giving it 5!) that would be fun for the entire family to read. This is definitely worth the $0.99. Check it out for some holiday cheer!"

Last night after finishing the book I asked Luke if he enjoyed the stories. ""I loved it,"" said Luke. (Meanwhile, Kajsa got far too squirmy to pay much attention after the first 10 minutes of any story). Luke ate it up though. The first of these three tales was published back in 1948! They concern the adventures of a young boy named Elmer Elevator and a baby dragon that he rescues in the first tale. Cute, light-weight stuff with a few illustrations sprinkled throughout. The end papers of the book are two different maps of the story's environs. Luke wants to make his own maps now."

Alice's Adventures in Wonderland perfectly weaves a coming of age story with satire and absurdity; Carroll does this in a cohesive yet messy way. I've known the story of Alice for the majority of the 25 years I've been on this planet, yet reading this book is a whole new experience. I now see how much depth this story has. Carroll's prose is clean and concise with a sense of whimsy and mischief. It's very hard for me to explain, but that is how I view his writing. The puns, jokes, and fallacies are perfect and feel incredibly natural; the story wouldn't be as effective without them. Alice is clearly geared towards children. But, Carroll proves that children's stories don't need to be dumbed down. He proves that in the content of the story, his prose, as well as with the intelligence and growth of Alice herself. This story is timeless, powerful, and fun. It's a classic for a reason."

When you are tired, beat down, wake up early and stay up late, and do it again day after day, sometimes you ask yourself why is being a parent some times so difficult? If you have one kid or 5 kids parenting is not the easiest job but it is maybe the most important job you will ever have and according to Paul Peters it is the greatest job in the world. One that you don't get paid monetarily, but by love, and all those little things that people that are not parents will probably never really experienced or might not ever understand. The Greatest Job In The World is about a man named Woodrow that is in search of the greatest job in the world. When asked what the greatest job in the world is, one might not think of parenting right away. In this simply worded children's book Woodrow goes to school to learn about and search out the greatest job in the world. He soon finds there are many that sound promising, but some of them don't work out so well. There are some that he only dreams about. There are jobs he finally does when he grows up, but he quickly finds out that jobs are important to different people, but you will only find out that parenting is the greatest job when you become a parent. As you can tell by now I love books with a great message. This book definitely has the message that your kid might not understand now, but they might remember this book when they have children of their own. The illustrations in this book are well done and unique and each page is simply worded. It is a short read! If you like books with a good message, and read I would recommend this e-book. Not too bad at $2.99 at Amazon.com. It is also available on a number of other formats."

 I really enjoyed what this story's overall message was- don't judge someone by how they look. Or, I guess today we would say it was a book on anti-bullying and the good and bad things that can and will happen to people (or in this story, animals) who don't care for one another the way we should. The overall message is love one another. The ""golden rule"" has dominated again. I am not complaining though, Today we need as many books about bullying as we can get until its second nature to be a giving non-judgemental person. 
 For me, though I did find this book interesting and even cute at times, it was just too long. It had too many characters that were less than secondary and were unnecessary, making it hard for even the oldest of the kids (me) to remain interested. At times I felt like I had read the same story several times with the only difference being a few names. I would suggest that this author keeps it simple when writing books on a topic that is already becoming over saturated for the age range this book would be suited to. 
 The added education about animals and their predators was interesting but added to the monotony and therefore the length of this story. However, I would give this story an overall 4 out of 5 stars because it was educational, it taught life lessons, and in general it was a good read. It also used animals instead of people as the characters which for many children, including one of my own, is better than reading about people as empathising with an animal that you naturally love is simpler than with a stranger."

 No organ or flowers. 
 Just a cross and a Bible,

 Beautifully written. There is a lot of sadness in this book. Loss of loved ones and innocence but live still has to be lived. That is what Tara finds out. 
 I did enjoy the clues and watching Tara and The Boy unravel them. Tara had to overcome some fears to do so and I thought that was strengthening for her character. 
 I like the butterflies, though I wasn't fascinated by them and their behavior didn't make anything sparkle for me. BUT I did enjoy the book! And I like the author. She's super nice. :)

 Jen gave me this lovely book for Christmas, and it was the perfect way to start off the reading year. You're likely to hear the 'timeless children's book' descriptor a lot, and with good reason. It's timeless in the sense that it's a non-specified date in the past (early 1900s? Later 1800s?) when women were not cellists and were not supposed to wear trousers, but when it also feels perfectly right for a delightful man like Charles to rescue a baby, take her home and raise her, without bothering either of them with stupid things like school. It's also timeless in that same way because it could be a Noel Streatfield if he got in a Nanny to help out. 
 Mostly, though, it made me think of A Little Princess, with a very different sense of social justice: no romanticizing of the diamond mines into something out of The Arabian Nights; no meek and grateful poor children, and no patient suffering. Sophie is a wonderful character, the rooftoppers she meets are heartbreaking and yet so strong, and I fell head over heels with Charles. It's whimsical and funny, too, which I don't think of A Little Princess as being, and yet ... that rooftop feast, for hungry Matteo (and Sophie, though hers was a voluntary hunger!), had the same emotional payoff as the one from the earlier book. 
 My only concern was that a bit of me wanted the ending tied up with a series of weatherproof (and not from pigeon fat) bows. So. There is now an epilogue in which Sophie's mother produces her birth cert, thereby clearing Charles, his scholarly work can be done perfectly well in Paris, and they set up a proper home for all the children together - one so free and with such perfect access to the rooftops that even Matteo feels safe there. I will not countenance Charles going back to London alone."

He or she might have a well connected family. While Casper Bengue is no slouch, that isn't what gives him the edge in Tom Angleberger's hilarious caper-filled novel Fake Mustache. Casper's edge has everything to do with his two newest possessions - a finely tailored man-about-town suit and, more importantly, the Heidelberg Handlebar #7. 
 The Heidelberg Handlebar #7 is a one of kind fake mustache so far removed from the fake mustache seen on joke glasses as to be an entirely different species. The wearer of this creation made from real Belgian hair has an unequaled influence on all who see it. Mild mannered accordion players, craft store workers and even school librarians become little more than a brainwashed criminal mob when confronted with the mustache. 
 Nerdy Lenny Flem Jr. knows precisely who is behind the powerful facial hair because he lent his friend Casper the last ten dollars needed to buy the mustache. Unfortunately, Casper knows precisely who tried to rat him out to authorities and uses the town of Hairsprinkle's morning television show to turn everyone against Lenny, the one they've been told is the Evil One by Fako Mustacho. 
 Nearly everyone that is. Lenny ends up with one ally at his side - Jodie O'Rodeo. The former tv star isn't shy about doing her own stunts and isn't going to stand for Fako Mustacho taking over the US in a rigged election. 
 Fake Mustache is a fast action read brimming with quirky characters, mayhem and unexpected solutions. Their are brave rescue attempts, perilous water bottles and stunts on horseback. Diabolical deeds seem to carry the day but the heroes just won't stay down. Adding to the chaos is a strange foreigner bent upon regaining his mustache. Lenny and Jodie O'Rodeo tell this series of Fako Mustacho's bid for power and their trials to bring him down in this romp of a middle grade novel that had me laughing from the moment I saw the cover. This book is begging to be shared with middle grade readers."

 Since this story is extremely short, the summary will be brief. 
 Basically, the plot of this book is about the reader seeing various animals comment on what other beings they are looking at that precise moment, while each animal states a variation of this quote: 
 ""Brown Bear, Brown Bear, 
 What do you see? 
 I see a red bird looking at me. 
 Red Bird, Red Bird, 
 What do you see? 
 I see a yellow duck looking at me."" 
 Wow! I cannot believe that I waited this long to finally pick up this popular children's book and it was definitely worth reading in the end! I loved the simplistic style that Bill Martin Jr. brought to this book as the plot is basically having readers see various animals in different colors popping up in the book and commenting on other animals they have seen. I loved the fact that each animal is a different color such as having a blue horse and a purple cat as it brings a unique spin to the storytelling of this book and I was quietly anticipating seeing what kind of animals we will see pop up in this book. Eric Carle's artwork is as always, a delight to look at as all the characters are rendered in paper cut outs which gives the book a creative look and I really loved the images of the different animals that show up in this book, such as the purple cat and the blue horse! 
 Even though there is nothing wrong with this book, I have to wonder why it was banned in the first place? Well, it turns out that when it was banned, the person who banned the book made a mistake regarding the author of this book, who is Bill Martin Jr. and the person thought that it was the same Bill Martin who wrote the book ""Ethical Marxism: The Categorical Imperative of Liberation."" Now, I have never read any of the ""other"" Bill Martin's books, but this was the first instance where a book was mistakenly banned for the wrong reasons and that got me curious yet annoyed. 
 Overall, ""Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?"" is a truly cute book for children who want to have fun with identifying animals and colors all wrapped up into one book! I would recommend this book to children ages three and up since there is nothing inappropriate in this book.

 It was time that I read more children's books from NetGalley and I happened to pick up another children's book from NetGalley called ""Argyle Fox"" by Marie Letourneau and I actually found this book to be quite cute! 
 The story starts off with a young fox named Argyle Fox who wanted to go outside and play, but his mother warns him that it is very windy outside and that he might not be able to play the games that he wanted to play. But, Argyle Fox went outside to play with his cards anyway and while Argyle was playing with his cards, the wind blows his cards away and Argyle had to go back home to find something else to play with. Argyle then finds an old spider costume and decided to play as a spider in the trees outside. But the squirrels warned Argyle that it is too windy outside to play as a spider. But Argyle ignored the squirrels' warnings and continued playing outside, but then the wind comes up and blows at Argyle, which causes him to get tangled in his homemade webs. Argyle then goes back home and tried to find another game to play outside and every time Argyle tries to find a new game to play on this windy day, the wind just keeps on messing up his games. Just as Argyle was going to give up playing games outside, his mother quietly encourages to think of another game to play on a windy day. 
 What game can Argyle play on a windy day? 
 Read this book to find out! 
 I have been reading many children's books that deal with the main characters (usually children) trying to find a fun game to play whether they are inside or outside and it has been awhile since I had read such as book as this. Marie Letourneau has done a great job at telling a story about a young fox's determination to play outside, despite it being a windy day and I enjoyed seeing the various games that Argyle tries out on the windy day such as playing as a spider and playing as a pirate. I also like the fact that Argyle never gave up on trying to find the right game to play on the windy day as it shows that he has a lot of determination in trying out various games, no matter how windy the day got. I really loved the fact that Argyle's mother was supportive of Argyle's determination in finding the perfect game to play on a windy day as it was great seeing a parent support their child during their time of need and I liked the fact that Argyle's mother encouraged Argyle to find a different game that would be more suitable to play in the wind. Marie Letourneau's artwork is adorable and colorful to look at as I loved the images of Argyle Fox doing different activities such as playing as a spider and playing as a pirate and I also loved the images of the wind coming in with the words ""WHOOSH"" accompanying it as it gives it a huge presence in the story. 
 The reason why I gave this story a four-star rating was because even though I found the story to be really cute, I have already read plenty of children's books where the main character is trying to find a new game to play either outside or inside the house and I just found this story to be a bit repetitive at this point. 
 Overall, ""Argyle Fox"" is a truly cute story about encouraging children to find good games to play on a windy day and I would recommend this book to children ages four and up since there is nothing inappropriate in this book.

""You Are Special"" is a truly unique children's book written by Max Lucado along with illustrations by Sergio Martinez that many children and adults will enjoy for the heartwarming message about being yourself. 
 Once upon a time, there was a little village where wooden people called the Wemmicks lived at and they were all created by a wood worker named Eli. One of the main activities that the Wemmicks participated in was putting on golden stars and gray dots on each other. The gold stars would represent how much talent that person would have, such as having smooth wood and fine paint on their bodies and being able to do spectacular tricks such as knowing big words and jumping over tall boxes. The gray dots would represent the less attractive side of each person, such as if their wood and paint is not pretty or if they cannot do any kind of spectacular stunts, then they are awarded a gray dot. One unfortunate wooden person named Punchinello was the one who was always getting gray dots due to him not being able to do any fantastic stunts and not having smooth wood and fine paint on himself. Punchinello was so upset about all this that he decided not to go out into the village for fear of being given a gray dot for no reason at all. One day, however Punchinello meets a wooden girl named Lucia who does not have any stars or dots on herself and when Punchinello wanted to know about why Lucia does not have any dots or stars on her, Lucia tells him that he should go see Eli. 
 What will Eli tell Punchinello? 
 Read this book to find out! 
 Now, when I saw the ""10th Anniversary"" golden badge on this book, I was wondering to myself about how come this book has such a badge on the cover, as books that usually have an anniversary badge on their cover would have to be pretty well known in the reading community. As it turns out, this book was pretty popular back in the late 1990s, it is just that I have not read this book until just recently and I honestly did enjoy the cute message of this book! Max Lucado's writing is truly heartwarming and creative and I loved the fact that the main characters were little wooden people who all resemble the puppet characters from ""Pinocchio"" (heck, the main character Punchinello is similar to Pinocchio) since I always loved stories that involved puppets. I felt that having the main characters as wooden people really gave the book a creative flair that really made this book stand out from the other children's books I had read. I also loved the way that Max Lucado presented the message of being happy with who you are no matter what other people say as Punchinello is mistreated by the other Wemmicks because of the fact that he keeps getting so many gray dots on his body. It was interesting seeing the parallels of prejudice in this book as the Wemmicks judge others by the amount of stars and dots they have on their bodies and it's similar to how people in real life judge a person based on their accomplishments rather than who they truly are. Sergio Martinez's artworks is truly beautiful to look at as the Wemmick population looks extremely creative since they are drawn as wooden people and yet they act like and move like human beings. I also loved how gorgeous the landscape looks as the Wemmick village truly stands out in this book as it looks like an old fashioned village from the Renaissance era and yet, it is unique due to the wooden people occupying the village. 
 The reason why I gave this book a four star rating was because even though I loved the message of this book, I felt that the book was a bit too slow in some parts and that sort of slowed down the story for me. 
 Overall, ""You Are Special"" is a great book for children who want to learn about the importance of being yourself and to remember that there are people that care about you, no matter what anyone else thinks. I would recommend this book to children ages five and up since there is nothing inappropriate in this book.

""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is definitely the best out of all of Dr. Seuss' books that many children will enjoy for many generations. 
 Dr. Seuss' tale of finding the true meaning of the Christmas spirit has been memorable in many generations' eyes and the writing is excellent as it is written in a creative way by using a rhyming text that truly showed the creativity of this book. Dr. Seuss's illustrations are extremely creative especially when most of the images are in black and white, but Dr. Seuss uses some red coloring in the images from the Grinch's Santa suit to his red eyes to represent the colors of Christmas. 
 Parents should know that the Grinch might scare smaller children, especially since the Grinch is drawn in a very menacing way with his red eyes and his evil scowls. Also, smaller children might be upset at the fact that the Grinch steals all the Whos' presents without remorse and that might upset many children who are afraid that their presents would get stolen by a mysterious stranger. 
 ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is Dr. Seuss' greatest classic as it shows children what the true meaning of Christmas is really all about and has remain to be a true classic in many generations' hearts. I would recommend this book to children ages five and up since the images of the Grinch might scare smaller children.

""The Lorax"" may have some controversial issues, but it is still a great book for both children and adults to treasure for many years. 
 Dr. Seuss' story about how chopping down too many trees can destroy the Earth's environment is truly powerful and moving as it realistically portrays what can happen to the environment when trees are cut down through Dr. Seuss' childish world. Dr. Seuss' illustrations as always are extremely creative and inventive especially when we are first introduced to the land of the Truffula trees, the land is colourful and peaceful looking, but when the once-ler starts cutting down all the Truffula trees, the land looks dark and bleak, representing the pollution that is caused from cutting down the trees. 
 Parents should know that even though I personally do not see anything wrong with this book, this book was considered extremely controversial due to the fact that many people believed that the book was trying to promote the idea that industrialization is a bad thing. Personally, I think that this book was just trying to discuss about the issues of environmentalism and that cutting down too many trees can cause pollution on the earth. 
 ""The Lorax"" is one of the greatest books about the issues of environmentalism that kids will understand perfectly and will definitely be evolved into one of the greatest cult classics to ever come to the world of children's books. I would recommend this book to children ages five and up due to the controversial material about whether or not industrialization is a good or bad thing for the world that small children might not understand.

""Pierre: A Cautionary Tale"" is about a young boy named Pierre who never cared about hurting other people's feelings until a lion comes for a visit. This book will definitely be a cult favorite among children who are fans of Maurice Sendak's works. 
 Maurice Sendak has done a superb job at both illustrating and writing this book. Maurice Sendak's writing is similar to Dr. Seuss' famous rhyming prose as Maurice Sendak writes the story in a rhyming prose, making the story extremely creative to read. Maurice Sendak also creatively and effectively relates the consequences of not caring about the world and how not caring could become dangerous if one is not careful. Maurice Sendak's illustrations may seem a bit simplistic, but the characters are lively and detailed enough to entice many children to read this book, especially of the images of Pierre with his blue outfit and his scowling facial expressions. 
 Parents should know that the scene where Pierre is eaten by a lion might scare smaller children, even though this scene is not that graphic since the next images just shows the lion picking his teeth and his belly getting large. Parents should reassure their children that if they do not care about the world, it does not mean that a lion will eat them, but that there are other consequences that children might face if they do not learn to care for other people like being shunned by other people. 
 ""Pierre: A Cautionary Tale"" is a terrific book about the consequences of not caring about other people's feelings and it will surely interest children for many years. I would recommend this book to children ages five and up due to the scene where the lion eats up Pierre.

 It's also a mistake that I've seen Disney's and Burton's Alice movies long time ago. Both are very very different from the original Alice, although I must admit Disney's version is a little bit more like the book unlike Burton's Alice which in my opinion isn't even ment to be faithful to the book in any matter (they are both fine movies, although Disney's Alice is really annoying brat). 
 Alice really is a very annoying in Disney version and she is also annoying in the book but most annoying there are the other creatures. The book is so upside down and sometimes very difficult to read especially for an adult. I don't know if the book would have made more sense if I would have heard or read it as a child. But I do believe children get more of it. And it is a children's book. It's really a shame I've grown up :( 
 I do understand why the book is a classic and why so many loves it but I also believe the most of the love for adults is more or less nostalgia. I should ask those adults opinion who are reading the book in their adult years what they like of the book. 
 I need to read the Through the Looking-Glass yet and I would have already read it if the book where are the both stories would have been found in the libraby (it was ment to be in the shelve but it wasn't there. It's always hard to find anything from the children's section because you know all books are exactly somewhere else where they shouldn't be).

Mr. Hollister's store, The Trading Post, is burglarized, and after alerting the police, Mr. Hollister turns his attention to his latest invention, a collapsible canoe. A landowner named Mr. Tucker, who is interested in the canoe, gives the family permission to stay in Spruce Forest and test the craft, but strange events occur as soon as the Holllisters set off on their camping trip. A scarecrow issues a warning telling them to go back, and as the days pass, the admonitions become more dangerous. Soon it becomes evident that something odd is taking place in the forest, and the Hollisters are quickly caught up in several intertwined mysteries, including kidnapping and uranium mining. 
 Although the Hollister family faces a multitude of hazards and encounters several interesting characters, their good will and spirit carries them on, proving that kindness goes farther than cruelty. The story occurs mostly in Spruce Forest, providing readers with descriptions of wildlife and wilderness survival which are as relevant in the modern era as they were when the book was originally published, making this a fun and interesting read both for those who are familiar with the series and for newcomers."

 I came across this book today and just had to open it.

I just intended to read a few poems, but before I knew it I was halfway through, and it seemed silly to stop at that point. Besides, I hadn't come across my favorite poem yet. Not that I remembered what my favorite was, but I just knew I would recognize it when I came across the right one. 
 And I did. 
 FROZEN DREAM 
 I'll take the dream I had last night 
 And put it in my freezer, 
 So someday long and far away 
 When I'm an old grey geezer, 
 I'll take it out and thaw it out, 
 This lovely dream I've frozen, 
 And boil it up and sit me down 
 And dip my old cold toes in. 
 Which seems terribly appropriate, as I've been all stressed out and tired lately, and taking the time to rediscover this book again, after such a long time where it just sat on its shelf, was utter bliss. 
 Also, I still wish you could freeze dreams like that. 
 Anyway, much love. I think I can probably identify this book as my introduction to a lifelong love of all things morbid-strange-sweet-sad-twisted. I can certainly thank Tim Burton for that as well, but Shel Silverstein really started it."

The 5-yr-old thinks they are hilarious and has memorized several books. The two youngest act out the story lines during their play time. 
 My older boys (both 11) will read these on their own. Even I think they're hilarious. The illustrations are trademark Mo Willems and I am constantly amazed that he can create so much emotion with just a few lines. When Gerald the elephant is worried or scared, he LOOKS worried or scared. And of course, the Pigeon always makes an appearance on the back inside cover of every book, which my boys hunt for.

I wish that it had told why she died instead of just saying ""she never returned to her land"". 
 This would be all you need (along with a Jamestown book) for K-2nd or 3rd grade. After that you could use this, but might want something more substantive.

I thought the pictures were pretty. I thought the story was great because of how clever the fox was in making a kite and all those other things he did even if the wind didn't let him do it. I don't know why he couldn't do the other things in the wind except the cards - because they would fly away. How does a soccer ball fly away? My favorite part was when he decorated his kite. I hope my mom buys this book. 
 My Mommy Review: ARGYLE FOX by Marie Letourneau is a wonderful read that I can't wait to buy and add to my favorites library for the kids. The story is about a little fox that is trying to play outside but everything he tries is ruined by the wind. Will the little fox prevail and find something fun or will he give up and just stay inside? It's a good lesson for children to keep on trying and enjoy the playfullness that comes with trying and pretending. The text of the story is age appropriate for a 1st grader and up to read. My son liked listening to it as well as a toddler . The illustrations are playful and will give the adult reading many prompts to engage their audience with questions like ""what would you make for the wind?"" or ""what costume would you wear"" when he puts on the spider costume.

 After all these years, I have finally read Alice's Adventures in Wonderland... and I liked it much more than I thought I would. This is such a fascinating book because it's so simple and - on the surface, at least - so nonsensical, but underneath lies a layer of complexity which I can't wait to dive into once I begin studying this. This is a book which is both fun to read and fun to study and, as I've said many times before, that's my favourite kind of book. I can see why adults and children alike adore this book. I can see myself coming to adore it even more when I read it again, to be honest. 
 I think everyone is pretty familiar with the concept and basic plot (if you can call it a plot) of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland from the film adaptations and from general pop culture. For that reason, little of what happened in here came as a surprise. I felt as though I had seen virtually every scene before even though this was my first time reading this book. However, what was surprising to me was just how funny this book was. There is an omniscient third person narrate who often engages in a witty commentary of Alice's actions and I found that very amusing indeed. Then the constant riddles and contradictions appealed very much to my sense of humour too. Familiar as this story felt, I still thoroughly enjoyed reading it. 
 Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a whimsical and fun story for children which paints an exquisite picture of a wonderful fantasy land which has become so recognisable in the many decades since it was published. However, this is book (much like everything in Wonderland) is more than at appears. The notes in my edition barely scratch the surface of this novel's complexity, and I can't wait to read more about it in the coming months. This gorgeous novel is exactly my cup of tea, and I hope that studying it will be just as pleasurable as reading it was. 
 This is a review of just Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the first Alice book that Lewis Carroll wrote. For ease (and to help my Goodreads challenge!) I will be reviewing Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There separately once I'm finished reading it."

Substitute Creature's cover is just as awesome and weird, if not more so, than the others in this series. It even freaked my mum out when she walked past the book! Charles Gilman has done it once again; created another fantastic book in the Tales from Lovecraft Middle School series! I never thought I'd enjoy reading a middle-grade book so much, let alone a series. I've always found that middle-grade characters are just too immature for my tastes, but Robert and his friends are very grown up for their age! Just because these books are meant for younger readers, it doesn't mean that only that age group can read them! I believe that anyone, whether you're a young-adult or just an older adult, should try them - you'll easily get swept up in the suspense, mystery and adventure. 
 Substitute Creature is packed full of action, and twists that will keep you guessing until you've reached the end of the book! The illustrations throughout this series are fantastic and really creepy - I love them. They add an edge to the book and help make it as wonderful as it is. I love going along for the ride on Robert's and his friend's adventures - and there's always something different, yet important, in each and every book! The Lovecraft Middle School is an enchanting and freaky place to be, with some terrifying and fascinating monsters that I'm sure will creep out even the bravest of people. 
 With every novel, Charles Gilman's writing just keeps getting better and better, and I love slowly getting to know our main characters. Robert, Glenn and Karina are really fun and interesting kids to read about; they're all kind, funny and such a joy to read about. Our main characters all come from very different backgrounds, and have very different personalities, but they don't let that get in the way of their friendship - and this is one of the main reasons why I love them so much. There aren't a lot of kids now who put prejudices' aside and just be friends with someone. I especially love Robert, who was able to actually forgive Glenn for bullying him in the past. 
 Overall, I really loved Substitute Creature, it was an amazing book - and as I've said plenty of times before, a brilliant middle-grade series! Charles Gilman's writing is fun, creepy, unique and quirky all at the same time - he's definitely someone I want to read even more from in the future. I believe it well and truly earned the 4/5 star rating I gave it, and I can't wait for the next book in this series - especially seeing as the end of Substitute Creature had a big cliff-hanger! Why do we have to wait so long for the sequel? I'll just have to wait until I get my hands on it!"

Although perhaps Anais masters the language a little swiftly than might be expected, she still struggles with idioms and odd turns of phrase and the inconsistency of the language as do many native English speakers, let alone immigrants. While I like the story and know that many recent young arrivals to this country will see their own experiences mirrored here, I would have liked an afterward explaining the conflict in the Congo which led to the family's flight. Since the story is told through a series of letters written to her grandmother by Anais over the course of her school year, readers are allowed to see her perspective on the oddness of many American customs and how she copes at a new school and challenging living conditions. I enjoyed her attempts to match make two of the adult figures in her life who have made school more bearable, and I appreciated how her letters often mentioned her concern for her father and older brother who are still abroad. I also smiled as she labored mightily at times to figure out one good thing about America to share with her grandmother. As might be expected, sometimes she's hopeful, but at other times she is preoccupied and sad. I was a bit curious as to how the letters that went to and from New York arrived so quickly and whether it would be likely that she'd find friendship among the youngsters she met at school, all from many different places and speaking different languages. While not perfect, this book gently introduces readers to the struggles someone like Anais might experience in a new land with which she is completely unfamiliar. To tell the truth, she copes a lot better than most of us would if the situation were reversed, and she continues to have hope for a brighter future."

Since Alice met a guy on their trip to Paris and is preparing to leave London to study in the United States, she treats Phoebe in a dismissive fashion. Phoebe is desperate to get that closeness back, and when she finds a valuable Cartier compact in a Paris flea market, she decides to follow the instructions in the letter than is hidden inside. The letter, written by one sister to another sister during WWII, supposedly contains a spell for erasing distance between two individuals. With her friend, Ned, off Phoebe sets, on a scavenger hunt to find all the places listed on that letter. But even if she finds all the places, will it be too late to fix things between her and Alice? The story is essentially a love letter to London, and it would be cool for any middle grader traveling there to find the places listed in the book, just like Phoebe does. One of the best things about this book is how the characters, including the adults, wrestle with an ethical dilemma concerning the compact. Anyone who liked My Secret Guide to Paris will enjoy this as well as those who enjoy discovering the hidden treasures in a city. The characters are well drawn and have plenty of kid-appeal. My only problem with the story was how easily Phoebe finds all the sites she was looking for and how she even manages to locate Sheila, the writer of the letter that sent her off on that journey."

Starting more than 1 million years ago in Africa and ending in 1969 when the first humans walked on the moon, Augustus and Professor Tempo make 28 different stops at important points in Earth's history. History books often focus only on the great conflicts that have swept across the land, but this one has its travelers touching down at places that are architecturally unique such as the Great Wall of China, the Roman Colosseum, and meeting Gutenburg, Chaucer, and Shakespeare as well as celebrating the end of slavery and the advent of women's suffrage. The digital illustrations are funny, and the text contains all sorts of interesting facts worth sharing with others. This sort of approach to history is sure to entice reluctant historians, simply because it is fresh, fun, and interesting. The book was originally published in Great Britain."

While the rest of us are sleeping quietly in our beds, the night children are scampering through the yards and streets making mischief. They are the ones responsible for leaving frost on windows, taking bits of the moon, and scattering leaves all across the yard. While the book is rather scary in some respects--even though the children are actually wearing knitted hats that make them look more frightening--the book ends on a reassuring note as a boy goes about his day and the night children are quietly sleeping. I like how the book gives an explanation for all the things that happen during the night, and I like the atmospheric illustrations that fill the book's pages."

Winter usually brings with it cold temperatures and snow and ice so the author suggests that readers bundle up before heading outside. Readers also will learn about how streets are made safe for travelers after a snow storm as well as seeing what a blizzard looks like. BRRR! I wonder how many of these scenes will occur during this winter. Part of the Little Pebble series, this book is well suited for beginning readers. It might not tell readers all about winter weather, but it's certainly a good starting point."

Nothing could be more disappointing. But as it turns out, keeping Penny out of trouble is almost more than Pistachio can do. The hilarity mounts up as Penny steals fruits in the grocery store, has an encounter with a witch, and swims in the park fountain to find coins, which causes trouble for Pistachio. Although Pistachio is exhausted and ready to be done with her sister by the end of the day, once she learns what the alternative is, she changes her mind. Filled with humorous mishaps and authentic dialogue and experiences, this book, the second in a series, will appeal to elementary readers. The facial expressions on the characters are priceless as is Penny's insistence that she is Super-Rabbit. Older siblings will certainly be able to relate."

But when it's time for bed, she realizes that she has forgotten to bring her beloved stuffed animal, Froggy. How can she possibly sleep without her friend? Being a good friend, Pip comes to her rescue and makes the ultimate sacrifice so she can finally get some rest. Young readers will relate to this sweet story of friendship and enjoy the illustrations that have been created in gouache."

Although she planned to go as Frankenstein as a match with her friend Leo's Dracula, her friend Emma wants them to go as fairies from the Fairy Club books. Not wanting to disappoint either friend, Chloe has to do some quick thinking and creative crafting to come up with a solution. I wasn't really surprised by the book's ending although I did like the fact that Chloe did not compromise on what she wanted to do. The illustrations, created with pencil and then digitally colored, contain all sorts of necessary objects for creating costumes. Readers may enjoy the repeated lines of ""here...here...and here"" (unpaged) that add humor in a couple of places in the book."

Although his early school days were unpleasant, he found a niche in high school with others who enjoyed math just as much as he did. This biography describes how his obsession with math and perhaps his mother's taking care of all the little details in life for him, insured that he had little notion how to perform basic tasks such as doing his laundry or buttering his bread. Although I can't imagine living the particular life he did, this lively story intrigued me as did the notes from the author who describes her own interest in this unique man from Hungary and from the illustrator who made sure to include math within the illustrations on each page."

As her mother hides away in their crumbling Louisiana mansion, Tara and a reluctant Riley head off to the island of Chuuk to solve the mystery and somehow save the butterflies her grandmother has been studying. Although I liked how there were so many suspicious characters and twists and turns and how Tara had to rely on her wits to solve the puzzles her grandmother left her, everything was resolved rather fast in the end, and I was still left wondering about those butterflies. How in the world did they manage to visit Tara at just the right time? Grammy Claire took a lot of chances that Tara would figure everything out and even risked her grandchildren's lives, something that I'm not sure most grandmothers would do. In the end, the story felt unfinished with a lot of issues unresolved. The beautiful passages describing the butterflies made me gasp in awe, though, and I could understand why Grammy took the risks she took."

The double-page spread that shows the dragons high in the sky, soaring over Knight School, is painted from a perspective looking down on them, which makes it particularly appealing. I enjoyed the dragons' sleepiness and their size, but the language used in the rhyming text itself didn't particularly impress me. The visual images are what's noticeable in this book."

The bears have been kept in cages so that their bile can be extracted for use in traditional Chinese medicine. Some of the bears like Jasper can't even move in their small cages. Once the bears arrive at the sanctuary, doctors and caregivers try to repair their physical and emotional wounds. Young readers will be inspired by Jasper's slow road back to health and his willingness to trust humans again. To date, the animal rights group has rescued more than 380 bears. Back matter includes photos and notes from the writing and illustrating team who each describe their role in the book project or their involvement with the moon bears."

After his best friend Casper Bengue purchases a mustache with certain powers, Lenny Flem suddenly finds the two of them at odds. Casper, it seems, has plans to take over first the costume prop store and then the nation's presidency. Once Lennie realizes that his seventh grade friend is a bank robber, he knows he must stop him even as the mustache continues to mermerize everyone around him. He ends up connecting with Jodie O'Rodeo, a teen has-been who actually can perform her own horse tricks and is as brave and daring as they come, and together, they set off on a merry chase to prevent the plans Casper has set in motion. The scenes with Jodie and Lenny were appealing, but this was just too over-the-top for my tastes. All the adults seemed to forget the truth too quickly and fall under the thrall of the moustache and Lenny rapidly. Why were Jodie and Lenny immune to its charms? All those critical comments aside, I have no doubt that middle grade readers will gobble this one up."

Piggy keeps waiting for him to get to the point, but it takes awhile to do so. Of course, the cause of the break is somewhat anticlimactic, and Piggy races off to share the story with another friend when she, too, has the same problem. I like the characters and their antics and the simple illustrations more than Should I Share My Ice Cream, but most of the youngsters I know don't know how to cut to the chase when telling a story. This one might have more appeal for adults than children."

His cat, Earl, also loves to cuddle up with Bobo. When Willy wakes up one day and can't find his beloved companion, he seaches everywhere before finding Bobo nestled under the covers with Earl. From there on, the battle is on with Willy trying to keep Bobo to himself, and Earl dragging him off. The simple illustrations capture Willy's determination not to share, and Earl's own persistence in sneaking off with Bobo."

They tow an iceberg home, and then slice the ice into bits to use in various creative ways to keep themselves cool. This wordless picture book pays tribute to the pigs' ingenuity and determination to solve their problems. The illustrations, rendered as etchings, show the pigs' air and sea travel and clever inventions. My appreciation for this title has increased each time I have read it."

My most recent read of a book like this is Junie B. Jones and the Mushy Gushy Valentime by Barbara Park. This one is a book that Sean picked out at the last BookCrossing meeting by pulling it off the Dublin Friends of the Library shelf. 
 The title and the cover illustration told me it would be a quick read but I had the feeling I wouldn't enjoy it. It just seemed too cute. I decided to give it a read when I was stuck on a much harder book and needed a little fluff for my brain. By the bottom of the first page, I was in love with the book: ""A 'nouncement is the school word for listen to me... and I MEAN it."" 
 Barbara Park clearly understands how kids that age (four to six) think. So many of things that Junie B. says and thinks are things that could have come out of Sean's mouth or the mouths of his friends. I was laughing on almost every page. 
 As a parent of a child who is almost ready for kindergarten, I found this book about a Valentine's Day party very funny. Junie B's narration with all of the types of mistakes I've heard my son and his friends make made me laugh. The teacher's exasperation at some of the children's antics rings true too."

 The earliest books are very short compared the newest ones. They are also short on plot. The gist here is that the siblings are still trying to learn who owns the tree house and how it works the way it does. In the middle of all of this are pirates who are out to get treasure. 
 If this were a later book there would be more information about piracy, letters of mark, the different nations involved in the Caribbean and so forth. As it stands, the pirates are merely caricatures and a means of putting the children in danger to move the plot."

 I had a beautiful edition, a little hardcover with a textured spine and deckled edges. It's illustrated by Chris Riddell, who is one of my favourite illustrators. I really liked the main character, Twig. He's a little bit like Bilbo Baggins in that he's from a very quiet, sheltered place and gets thrown into this huge adventure that never really stops. 
 I found it so engrossing and really couldn't put it down. I loved the plot and the creatures and the world-building. I like that the plot was a little more mature and dealt with slightly darker themes. 
 I loved this book so much, that after I bought the first one, I read it in a day and asked my mum to take me to the same bookshop the next day. And I bought books 2-5.

 Another top Dr Seuss book that was great fun to read."

 This has to be Dr. Seuss's most serious book, he tones down the silliness and tries to get across his warning. The illustrations are wonderful, the start is so bleak and drab, all shades of grey and once the story gets told the colours are so vivid they jump out of the page at you, only for you to watch the grey come back as the trees get cut down. 
 Wonderful story telling with a powerful message."

It's for younger children (early elementary school age) and the illustrations are really catchy, as well as the writing. It's meant to be accessible to young children, and I think that overall Jimmy conveys his message well to his intended audience. One complaint I do have is that I wish there had been a nod to disabled people, as this book talks about height and looks (like glasses or birthmarks) and I feel that a nod towards disabilities, and making the most of them, would make this book much more accessible. 
 Nonetheless, this is still a fun book, and I absolutely loved the illustrations, so I would share this with little children. 'Same is Lame' is a quite catchy catchphrase, and one I think applies to adults as well!"

I remember reading this from the library when I was a child. This book is dated to be sure, but it's still a nice sample of D'Aulaire art."

Heck, the pictures were more interesting than the story... though with the sparseness of the story, just almost any artist could have told a better story with illustrations. 
 The story itself is lacking, which brings the rating down to a 3. Many parts of the myth have been cut out, and the characters are portrayed as very simplistic. I know this is supposed to be a children's book, but there was no feeling to the words. The story was much better illustrated in the artwork, but the postscript/trivia at the back of the book made for a nice touch."

Some pictures in this book have borders lined with a variety of Katy's jobs or the vehicles used by the Highway Department. These are especially nice for little ones that can't read yet. The town map is also a great way to interact with a child; the numbered close ups in the border allow them to pick out where each building is located in town. A picture book means what the name indicates. It should combine story and illustrations to make magic, and that's exactly what Virginia Burton does."

Jane is funny and merry and determined to enjoy life at the Chalet School to the fullest - she is somewhat prevented from doing this by a truly vicious bullying campaign from Jack, including being physically attacked at one point (which is, of course, mostly treated as an understandable result of Jack's jealousy, rather than appalling behaviour). There's a play and then some drama which eventually makes Jack reconciled to Jane, of course. A pretty decent book given how close to the end of the series it is."

I do wonder though as to when and why Charlotte moved to Wisconsin. Was it with her parents and family? Did she move after she and her husband Henry Quiner were married? - some of these questions are answered later. 
 Caroline has two older brother - Joseph and Henry - an older sister Martha, younger sister Eliza, and younger brother (the baby) Thomas. Her father has been lost at sea for over a year and the family is suffering. Yet it's nice to see that Charlotte isn't shunned for being a widow. Her mother-in-law (Grandma Quiner) lives with the family (I love that old time family dynamic; it's unfortunate we don't have that often these days in the U.S.) and shopkeepers take her business. 
 Plus, the Carpenters (the father, Ben, in particular), are wonderful friends and make me smile. 
 I like that Martha, not Caroline, is the tomboy. I was getting a little tired of having the direct maternal descendants of Laura to be very much like her. 
 Like Caroline, corn is my favorite vegetable. It makes me want a small crop! 
 Yet we see how farmers (both then or now) truly depend on the weather. It makes me appreciate the farmers in my area much more. 
 ""Driving your duck to the wrong pond"" is an interesting phrase. 
 It's interested to see the details of how clothes were washed, particularly after reading of the washing of clothes in the Martha Morse years. 
 The stagecoach is a great reminder of life in different areas of the U.S. as technology and industry slowly made its way west. 
 The ""Such a Treat"" chapter made me tear up. 
 I find it amazing that the children would have time to walk almost three miles to and from school at dinner time! 
 And it's weird that there weren't assigned seating areas for different level learners. Even Charlotte had had that."

I think it definitely suffered because of the short length of the graphic novel(only 32 pages) and certain parts of my favorite childhood book were sadly left out.

 First of all, it says in the preface that these are not actual Chinese folk tales. Instead, there were the original tales, then their later translations. The those translations were compiled, summarized, and indexed. Her stories are simply her imagining what was really behind those two or three sentence summaries in the massive index. They are not the actual tales as they were told. It really bothers me that most people reading this are going to think that these are historical Chinese folk tales when they really aren't. And theoretically, there are translations out there. Why not use those to make a collection with a more authentic connection to the culture and history? 
 Secondly, many of the tales read awkwardly. Some are annoyingly colloquial, with weirdly specific snippets of actual conversation taking place that were both unnecessary and poorly done. Some have only very vague lessons or points to make. And most just seem to be good for a chuckle instead of having the wisdom of a timeless fable, and I think the author was intending the latter."

 The sheep is putting chickens to bed instead of little sheep, the duck almost put piglets to bed, the hen was putting lambs in the hen house while the pig was tucking in ducklings. 
 While simple that is pretty funny. Julia and both laughed out loud more than once. 
 The parents gang up and call the babies some funny names, trickers, rascals, etc. Then each parents goes to try to again put their children to bed amidst requests for more stories, more kisses, more anything. The pigs, and what they need, was particularly funny. 
 The last two pages are really cute, more so for adults maybe. Those pages show the four parents sitting in a group on some rocks... drinking tea. Duck has a teacup and tea pot and the rest have their cups and saucers. 
 The illustrations are average, what you'd expect for a story like this. The best thing about this one is it's good for just about any kid. A baby will listen and love looking at the pictures and it could be read all the way up to a little past toddler age. My daughter is almost 6 and she reads and listens to books far harder than this. We've been reading chapter books meant for older kids in some cases for quite awhile now. But she still enjoys pictures books also and this one we both enjoyed."

 This just wasn't as good as either book 1 (The Wizard) or book 3 (Ozma). I feel like there was a lot of filler dialogue, and the Woggle-Bug is the most Thoroughly Annoying character in Oz, partly because of the way he seems to inspire filler dialogue from those around him. Also I keep trying to calculate the timeline, because in book 1 it seems like the wizard has been ruling the Emerald City for a long time, like that he came to Oz as a young man and now he is old decades later, but here it's revealed that he usurped the rule of the Emerald City from a king and then subsequently hid his baby daughter, the rightful heir, who's like 13 years old tops when this story begins, and the timeline just doesn't work out? I missed the beginning of the book, though (my daughter read it with my husband while I was out of town before picking it up with me), so maybe I've missed something. Note that the Woggle-Bug puns, and commentary on their awfulness, went completely over her head.

 1. Leave nothing behind 
 2. Take nothing with you 
 3. Dress appropriately 
 4. Two arms, two legs, one head 
 5. No harming the natives 
 Sounds simple enough, if a little strange, right? But as twelve-year-old David, better known as Scrub, finds out, these rules may seem straight forward, but are much more complicated than he ever expected. 
 Scrub was hoping to spend his summer vacation shooting hoops so he'd be ready to try out for point guard next year, but instead his busy parents have packed him off for yet another summer, and this time he's off to his grandmother's inn, near the Canadian border in Washington state. The guests at the inn come to relax, getaway, and explore a new planet. Yup, the guests are aliens. And this summer Scrub's job is to make sure that the aliens abide by the house rules, by blending in enough to keep the town's, and particularly the sheriff's, suspicions at bay. 
 Even though Aliens on Vacation is science fiction, it driven more by character than plot. Scrub has an easy-going nature, and is resourceful, and wise beyond his years, but he's also lonely, and not always confident in himself and has some growing-up to do. Then there's the supporting characters: David's grandma, a kindhearted free spirit, who may be a little too trusting; the spunky and curious Amy who may know too much; Mr. Harnox, a seven-foot, bleach guzzling alien stranded on Earth; and then of course there's Sheriff Tate, suspicious of the goings on at the inn and determined to find the truth. Add in all of the extraterrestrial guests and the plot seemingly develops naturally out of the mix. How would you deal with an irate squid-like alien squishing through your door instead of the ocean planet he was planning on visiting? Or helping an alien disguise his third eye? 
 In case you thought Aliens on Vacation sounds like just a fun read, it's also a book about leadership, loyalty, responsibility, friendship, and acceptance. With great characters, plenty of action, and a healthy dose of humor, Aliens on Vacation is going to be an easy sell for the middle school set."

In The Forbidden Flats, Hope and her friends are again called on to do what they do best: save their families and friends from danger by taking calculated risks. In this sequel to Sky Jumpers, after a massive earthquake upsets the chemical balance in White Rock, the deadly band of gas known as ""bomb's breath"" begins to lower. Calculations reveal that the gas will be low enough to make White Rock uninhabitable in a little over three weeks, unless someone can fetch a specific chemical from the Rocky Mountains several hundred miles distant. 
 Of course, Hope and her friends join up, and much of their adventure involves dealing with the various towns and groups that have sprung up along the plains. As always, Hope is intrepid (sometimes too intrepid), and the story moves along quickly. Since Hope's character was established in the first book, we didn't learn as much about her in this sequel, but Hope learns more about her birth mother and the family she came from as they travel through the town where her birth-mother was born. 
 But mostly, I was impressed by the fun science in the book. I'm not a chemist (that's my husband), but Eddleman's ideas about how a massive ""green bomb"" might have changed the chemical characteristics of rocks was fascinating--and, of course, Hope and her friends still get to do cool gravity-defying feats involving the Bomb's breath. 
 I read this one quickly--now to pass it off to my kids!"

His grandmother is a little off, Scrub knows that. But he doesn't think she's as loony as he discovers. Her entire house, which is a bed and breakfast, is decorated as if she hasn't left the sixties behind. And the ""guests!"" Well, Grandma refers to them as ""tourists,"" are a little, uhm, strange, to say the least. They seem to have extra legs, arms and eyes. And what's with their skin? It's the color of clay! 
 Eventually Scrub learns that his grandmother hosts a Intergalactic Transfer Station; a place where visitors from other planets can enter Earth and stay for a visit. Part of his job duties during the summer will include dressing the aliens so that they blend into society. Surprising himself, Scrub finds he loves it! He loves the interaction and being kept busy. Plus there's an interesting young lady who is just determined to make his acquaintance. 
 However, said young lady's father is Sheriff Tate. Sheriff Tate is convinced something's going on at The Intergalactic Bed and Breakfast. He can't figure out what.

 I should imagine that there can be few people who have never seen the film version and so the sotry is quite familiar. Obviously there are a few differences though. First up was the fact that Baum pitches us pretty much right into the cyclone making nomention of the farmhands, the circus man or the neighbour with a grudge against Dorothy and Toto. The fact that these characters in the film then reappear as the main characters Dorothy encounters in Oz leads us to the conclusion that Dorothy's adventures are just a dream. This is not the case in Baum's novel which has the effect of making his story all the more fantastical but with no explanation of what or where Oz is. 
 Some of the other differences are relatively minor such as short episodes missed out of the screenplay and the fact that Dorothy's shoes in the book are silver rather than ruby as in the film. More significant, from the point of view of the structure of the story, is the fact that Dorothy and her companions make a journey to the south before she is able to return to Kansas. It is here that the meet Glinda, who is the Witch of the South in the book - the Witch of the North being and old woman, who reveals to Dorothy that her Silver Shoes could have taken her home right from the beginning if she had only tapped the heels together three times. It is almost tempting to credit Baum with using an archetype found in many stories (most famously the Alchemist by Paulo Coelho) in which the hero goes on a long journey only to discover that what was sought was on the doorstep at the beginning of the quest. As a reader though I would have been quite happy for Dorothy to return home in the balloon as she does in the film. 
 Throughout the book I found the writing to be quite flat. I got little sense of characterisation and, whereas it can often be disappointing to find that the screen characters are not as they were written, I felt that the film did a wonderful job with rather poor material. Furthermore I felt that the compassion of the Tin Woodcutter, the bravery of the Lion and the brains of the Scarecrow were rather too obviously signpostedvirtually as soon as these characters entered the story."

 The latest demon-in-disguise is Ms. Carcasse, the substitute librarian who becomes Glenn and Robert's sleepover pal when they are all trapped in the school during a ginormous snow storm. In addition to dealing with Ms. Carcasse, the boys are also suspicious of the crazy janitor, Maniac Mac, another possible threat they are forced to bunk with for the night. 
 Nefarious creatures aren't the only thing Robert is contending with, however. In this book, he also begins to come to terms with his crush on Karina, the third member of their trio. 
 Gilman has created yet another creepy tale for middle-grade readers (though older readers will find it enjoyable, as well). If you haven't read the previous three books, you will still be able to jump in and enjoy the story as is, though I suggest starting from the beginning only because this series is so fun."

The writing is soft, gentle, rolling. This is a very easy story to read aloud, and it's very engaging. The illustrations are a good match, soft and gentle. The book takes us through Baby Bear's day and all the different times that are good times to read/tell a story (upon waking, while eating, while sitting a the lake, before a nap, etc) finally ending with bed time stories and sleep. This is a good, calm, winding down story for bed time that also emphasizes how awesome and important stories are.

Friends Lenny and Casper become ""frenemies"" when Casper buys a fake mustache made from the real mustache hairs of a bad guy. Casper becomes infused with the bad guy's motives and begins robbing banks and businesses all with the master plan to take over the world (well at least the United States when he sets his sights on becoming the next president elect). It'll take a well known child actress and a lot of fast-thinking to outwit the former-best-friend-turned-evil-genius, but readers will love every chapter of it! Recommended for boys and girls grades 4-6. Short, action-packed chapters make this an excellent recommendation for boys who claim they don't like to read."

With his two 20 pound sledgehammers he demolishes a rock that a stick of dynamite didn't even dent. And with his 20 sledgehammers he also hammers a mile and a quarter into a mountain besting the steam drill which only managed to drill a quarter of a mile into the same mountain. 
 All legends pass in time, but in John Henry's case his followers celebrate the way he lived instead of feeling sorry for themselves when he passes. 
 A thrilling read with watercolor illustrations showcasing John Henry's momentous feats. John Henry is depicted as large, but not in a Hulk type of way which makes this tall tale more realistic. He's a large man yes, but under Pinkney's careful hand he doesn't resemble a beast. Good read."

Henry, Jessie, Violet, and Benny are brothers and sisters recently orphaned by the death of their parents (the cause isn't mentioned, just the fact that they have passed). Fearing their grandfather, the children try to make it on their own and adopt a red boxcar they find in the wilderness as their new home. The group does a good job taking care of themselves and Henry does odd jobs for the doctor in the next town so they have money for food, but when Violet becomes ill they are all in over their heads. The doctor heals Violet and reveals the wherabouts of his missing grandchildren to Mr. Alden. Everybody hits it off and the kids all move in with their grandfather. As time passes they find that they miss their boxcar and as a surprise Mr. Alden has it moved to his backyard giving readers a happily ever after. 
 A fast read. The artwork could've been better and the story is rushed as the entire chapter book is covered in 32 pages. This comic version seems to aim for a younger audience (1-2nd grade) while the chapter books were intended for middle grade readers. I'm a big Boxcar Children fan so if I'm recommending that series to a child I'm still reaching for the chapter book."

 In 1979 I was in fourth grade -- in Mr. Stockbridge's class. It was a small community and a close one, and without a word from me or my mother and father my teacher knew that my grandfather was fighting for his life and my preoccupation with my saddness had caused my schoolwork to suffer. My young heart was still broken from the sudden death of my uncle the year before, and often I'd find a tear in my eye as my mind wandered back and forth from the great times I had had with my uncle to my fears of my grandpa's impending end as I sat in my school desk. 
 One morning, after first recess and before lunch, Mr. Stockbridge announced that he was going to vary our schedule and read ""A Taste of Blackberries"" to the class. Most of us took out drawing paper and pencils and crayons to quietly draw as he read, and as I placed mine in the center of my desk, the teacher's voice began to carry the words from the book pages to swirl around us in the room -- creating waves and waves of images and colors and smells and emotions that washed over us and between us, as we drew, scribbled, or sat silently in the eddys caused by the story's words. 
 I rememeber looking up at my wonderful teacher, and seeing his returned glances and knowing smiles; I understood that he was reading the book for me -- for the struggle of loss that I was going through with my grandfather and for the struggle I had lived in enveloped in the sweet and innocent saddness that only a small child can posess. 
 This story affected everyone in my class, even at that age. I'm sure it helped us all deal with the losses that, like all people, were bound to touch us a we got older. It was a useful tool that in the hands of a caring onlooker worked to help ease the pain I had no tools of my own to deal with. 
 All of us loved our teacher -- deeply -- as he took time to help other children in the same manner he had helped me. Two years after we were his students, most of us gathered at the school in the middle of the summer -- the phone call all of our families had received had simply said that Mr. Stockbridge, his beautiful girls, his lovely wife and unborn child had not survived the canyon plane crash that also took the life of the pilot. The town came together -- the adults hugged each other and the children cried... and when the time came for us to be on our own later that day, I remember that one of my friends said, ""Remember that book he read to us? The Taste of Blackberries?"" And even in that sad place, with heavy hearts, we smiled remembering his care for us then and the knowledge that even if he was gone he had given us a gift -- able to still teach us even in the middle of the tragedy."

 It is books like these that made me decide to make travel my profession, which is was for 15 years. Othitis brought back my excitement of those days and I am sure she will have the same effect on her readers, young and old.

 Cartwheeling in Thunderstorms will break your heart over and over. Wilhelmina has spent her childhood in Africa running wild with the farm boys, especially her best friend Simon. She loves riding her horse, climbing trees and being free, but she also loves ironing her father's socks so he doesn't catch parasites because she loves her father very, very much. Will's mother died when she was young, and when her father becomes ill with the same cholera that killed her mother, Will's life changes drastically. She is suddenly ripped from her beloved home in Zimbabwe and sent to boarding school in London. The wild girl is soon broken and you will weep for her again and again. 
 Bianca Amato is perfect as Will. She sounds youthful and free. Amato does a splendid job voicing the African farmhands' Zimbabwean dialect as well as the snooty girls in the London. 
 There are a few technical problems with this recording, including a few pauses that were overly long and audible breath intakes, especially at the start of the chapters. However, the overall story telling is so good that these minor instances can be overlooked."

It makes for a great book to read and discuss with your kids. It will challenge them to think critically. And it's short so it's easy for busy grown-ups to find time to read. 
 I liked that this book does not dumb down the language just because it's a kid's book. The prose is beautifully descriptive and there were some great vocabulary words. I read it with my son and we looked up the words he didn't know as we went. It averaged one or two per chapter - not too burdensome. As Ms. Babbitt says in the interview in the back of the book, 
 ""Some time during the last forty years, people have decided that children can't understand any words that have more than four or five letters. That's just plain crazy...There's no other way to enlarge our vocabularies. The more words you have at your disposal, the easier it is to say what you want to say, specifically."" 
 This is a great book for middle graders when you're looking for something a little more sophisticated than the Wimpy Kid books and that ilk for a change of pace."

 ""Real isn't how you are made,"" said the Skin Horse. ""It's a thing that happens to you..."" 
 ""You Are Special"" is a sensitive, gentle, sweet and important book for children, and I highly recommend it."

 ""Yes, it's like a prison."" She gripped him tightly. ""It's like they've forgotten everything important, isn't it? I mean, forgotten that thinks like cats and dancing exist."" 
 A compact, not overly complicated little story about a lost girl trying to find herself and her mother, but told with great imagination, feeling, and even poetry. I loved the characters, perhaps especially Charles. 
 Ms. Rundell is a new author for me, but I look forward to exploring more of her books."

Hades decided Persephone should be his queen, so he scooped her up and took her down to his kingdom. 
 Persephone was depressed, and Demeter was angry. The daughter wouldn't eat, and the mother caused the earth to freeze up and bear no plants. For a whole year, nothing grew: 
 ""It was a year of hunger and misery. It was winter all the time. No one recognized the Great Goddess [Demeter], wrapped in her cloak, weeping and waiting for the world to die of hunger."" 
 Zeus, like many men, took a while to notice anything was different, and when he did, he sent his messenger Hermes down to Hades to retrieve Persephone. 
 Hades agreed to let her go, but asked Persephone to eat something first to have the strength to return. In this retelling, she takes three pomegranate seeds. (Other versions have her eating six seeds.) 
 In any event, she was allowed to return, but she had to go back to be with Hades for three months of the year - one for every seed she had eaten. When she was back in Hades, winter would come to the Earth, and when she returned, Demeter once again is happy, and Earth once again bears fruit. 
 English Illustrator (and sculptor) Virginia Lee uses lovely watercolors to depict the splendor of the Greek Gods and the changing emotions of the main actors in this story. (Her speciality is mythology, and she worked on the movie set of ""Lord of the Rings."") She does some amazing fantastical work that you can see on her blog, here. 
 Evaluation: The story of Persephone has a lot of appeal, and will no doubt inspire many questions from young readers (recommended for ages 7-10) about origin stories, mythology generally, and even morality."

It includes narrative, lots of vivid illustrations, and experiments to demonstrate how all things are made from just 92 chemical elements. 
 Each two-page spread has a clever title, like ""I'm Gonna Make You A Star"" and ""Dish the Dirt on Soap."" On the latter page, you learn what soap is made of, what scum means (a way to talk about hard water), and how to make elephant toothpaste! 
 You'll also find out about why the fizz in soda is worse for your teeth than sugar, how fireworks are made in different colors, how tall buildings stand up, and why salt helps make ice cream. (And yes, one of the learning experiments is a recipe for ice cream!) 
 At the end of the book, there is a glossary (""Cool Words"") and a list of resources, including websites, for further study. It also includes an awesome periodic table poster on the inside of the book jacket. 
 Evaluation: I can't recommend this one highly enough. It's guaranteed to keep children entertained and fascinated. I should add that I happen to have some children in my life who covet this book, but I love it too much to give it up. I do, however, share the experiments with them. Guess I'll have to buy them their own for Christmas...."

Typical designery prioritisation of graphics over other needs (grumble grumble). It's quite visually appealing, but a bit too stylised for me to love.

 So begins The Night Children. The illustrations pair well with the poetic words on each page. Night children come out with the shadows and wreak a little harmless havoc during the night. This book is a little bit mysterious and somewhat haunting. 
 Night children smirk and play whole-heartedly with leaves, trees, and the moon. They look for treasures in garbage cans and set spider webs to startle the unsuspecting. They are whimsy and mischief at night but tuck themselves away with the new day. 
 This book won't be for every child, even though nothing sinister happens. The children are a bit of cross between Peter Pan and his Lost Boys, but in an urban setting. They are wild and unpredictable. They wear loose snow hats with monster faces and horns on them that cover their eyes. I can see how very young children or those that tend to wake with scary dreams might want to wait until they're older.

I didn't enjoy the slapstick humor and I thought there was no depth to the characters. This book was recommended by a very reliable source, but it did not impress me. Its one redeeming quality is that it might appeal to reluctant boy readers."

 ORIGINAL 2015-04-21: This was recommended to me as a motivational book for my XX TD (female tax deduction), but the reading level is far below her age. I was dithering about whether to buy it because of that, but finally decided to get it from the library. It was in Kindle, so I borrowed it. 
 This is a book best enjoyed in print. While I make my living formatting ebooks, I have an aesthetic objection to putting awesome kids' books in ebook format. That's just me. 
 The illustrations were cute and Rosie's frustration feels real. I did enjoy this book; however, it's not one I'll buy because it's not useful for my kid for which it was recommended. Again, that's me. 
 It's a truly lovely book, and my enjoyment was only diminished because I read it on the Kindle app on my phone (inorite?!)."

This one is far down in quality from the first two and from later volumes, as I remember them. Again, there are no factual figures, and the pirates reek of '50s movies, rather than actual pirates. The writing is still engaging, and the characters are still fun. The best part of this book is the last ten pages, wherein you find out who M is. But no spoilers from me!"

We have had several rainstorms lately and she is fascinated by the worms that appear once the rain stops. When I saw the book ""Winnie Finn, Worm Farmer"" on the new arrivals shelf at the library, I took it home. It proved to be a good choice. The illustrations are wonderful. The fictional story contains multiple true life facts about worms and it is the story of a girl who uses her brains and know-how to accomplish something that all the adults she runs into say isn't possible.

 My daughter and step daughter enjoyed this book. My step daughter is an older child who is currently reading chapter books and my daughter is three. My step daughter enjoyed it but it is below her reading level and my daughter likes it because it rhymes and has pretty pictures. But she was too young to recognise most of the creatures in the story. 
 As for the artwork, the pictures are very good, if a bit dark at times. Both girls liked the brighter pictures more than the darker ones. 
 The book reads well and rhymes, which helps with the flow of the story. 
 I personally like it very much. I grew up wishing I could have any one of these creatures, though I didn't know about most of them at such a young age. 
 I feel there is a very small margin of children who would know what these creatures are and still young enough to want to read it. After explaining each creature to my daughter she enjoyed the book much more than before. A wonderful book for kindling the child's imagination.

This is definitely one of the longest Caldecott books I've ever read, so long they don't even put it in the picture book children's section of the library (it was in fiction). It won a 1942 Caldecott Honor. While I wasn't really a fan of the color illustrations (with the exception of the cover page and the two-page map journey in the back of the book), I loved the black and white ones because they were so detailed. The story is that a young Canadian Native American carves a figurine of a Native American paddling a canoe up in Nipigon and sends it on a journey to the Sea through the Great Lakes. It literally does go everywhere in that area and makes it all the way to France from in-land Canada. This book has become so famous, that in the real township of Nipigon, they have a statue dedicated to the book and there's a link for the movie version done in 1966: http://www.nipigon.net/content/Touris...

I had previously gotten the book ""Actual Size"" but it's a bit too advanced for him. Sadly, there is still a lot of text in it, and I would say he would need to wait about 4 yrs before he could really enjoy it and have the attention span to sit down and read it. It is a cute book with Jenkins' trademark cut-paper illustrations, which I love so much. It tells little stories about each animal/bird/insect and what they eat.

 Review: 
 I enjoyed reading this book. The friendships created were easy and plentiful, much like how children make friends. There were the happiest of moments, scary moments, and very sad moments. This book takes you through all of the emotions. Yes, I even caught myself sniffling and needing a tissue. 
 While reading this tale, I kept picturing the animals talking to each other in cartoon form in my head. I hope this becomes a new favorite in everyone's home -- on book and DVD. 
 Thunder was my favorite character. Frederick was probably my least favorite. Soma was my second favorite for her honesty and vulnerability. 
 Recommended read."

Baby Sophie is saved by Charles, an eccentric bachelor who adopts her and raises her in London. Together, they read Shakespeare, sing to birds, climb wardrobes, draw on the walls, wear trousers, and forget to eat. Now a young girl, Sophie is told by child protective services that she is to be sent to an orphanage, so she and Charles escape to France to hunt her mother, who may be a cellist living on the rooftops of Paris. Midway through the book, Sophie meets Matteo and his friends, who live on the rooftops and in the tree of Paris. Matteo and company agree to assist Sophie in her mission, so they romp across Parisian rooftops, scaling drainpipes, eating charcoal-cooked rats, and searching for Sophie's mother. The book's theme is never ignore the possible. My only complaints are that the character of Charles, a rare adult who understands children's need for adventure, recedes a bit too much to the background when Sophie meets Matteo, and the book ends much too abruptly."

After hearing her talk about her work and her art, I appreciate and admire her books even more. Mainly she works in collage, though her cut out books, namely Color Farm and Color Zoo, are equally creative and detailed.

It was a golden time for children's literature, particularly from the Oxford Press. They are very middle class books about ponies and a comfortable family life. They also promulgate values like duty, honesty, not lying, doing your bit etc. which are not much seen in children's fiction these days. 
 The series is having a resurgence as older readers have a nostalgic reread. 
 This story brings the Thornton family to the farm and the finding of the black hunting whip brings some surprising events and closure. 
 A gentle story well written and an excellent piece of research for readers who need to know what life was like in the mid 20thC."

Long after losing my appetite for R.L. Stine's ""Fear Street"" or the frightful suspense of Alvin Schwartz' ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"", Silverstein's whimsical passages continue to invoke nostalgic and thoughtful reflection. Of ""The Giving Tree"", my mother echoes the undeviating refrain that it is a woeful fable of an ungrateful child and a loving, long suffering parent. I respond with a nod of agreement and apology having learned better than to quarrel with her interpretation of that particular work. 
 ""I've discovered a way to stay friends forever-- 
 There's really nothing to it. 
 I simply tell you what to do 
 And you do it!"" ~ Friendship 
 His deeply imaginative ideas combined with a rich awareness of words to craft a collection of clever cerebral exchanges. Silverstein chose not to endeavour making sense of the utter nonsense which exists in the dreams of children. In his poems and illustrations, there resides an inquisitive surreality of characters and circumstances which are at times morbid, silly, unusual, somber, capricious, self indulgent or inappropriate. That array of attributes represented a wider spectrum than most children's literature of his era had considered yet all were qualities of which any child might be possessed. 
 ""I shot an arrow toward the sky, 
 It hit a white cloud floating by. 
 The cloud fell dying to the shore, 
 I don't shoot arrows anymore."" ~ Arrows 
 In spite of resolute parental naivete on our part, children are not yet whole beings. They are evolving and developing with each new insight which should arise. Why should they not be given the full palette of human emotion in which to dabble their paintbrush while there remains a steady hand to guide their intentions? Silverstein recognized children were smarter than adults acknowledged and wrote images filled with riddles, trap doors and passageways into the unknown. 
 If confusion arose as to the meaning of any given story, there was no discernible moral interpretation at the end. He trusted that children could ask questions and sort out those quandaries on their own. What if they could send away in the mail for a new set of parents as does the young man in ""Clarence""? Is it such a terrifying thought that every child might at some moment dislike their parents? Or desire to join the UCR (Union for Children's Rights) and dispense with performing chores until their demands are met? 
 ""Now I lay me down to sleep, 
 I pray the Lord my soul to keep, 
 And if I die before I wake, 
 I pray the Lord my toys to break, 
 So none of the other kids can use them... 
 Amen."" ~ Prayer of the Selfish Child 
 Silverstein wrote in the tradition of the grand triumvirate alongside Seuss and Sendak. Authors of juvenile literature who were unafraid to stretch and layer their passages into the space of fascination and fantasy. Could those arcane worlds engaged in Harry Potter or ""The Hunger Games"" exist without the precedent laid by the dragon of Grindly Grun, the Gooloo bird or the quick digesting Gink? 
 Silverstein can be an especially difficult read when one has spent a lifetime having their language skills battered into shape by each gruesome guardian of the English oral tradition. His random meter and loose leaning prose lead one to imagine they are reading another language entirely. I surely realize now that he inspires the same wonder and bewilderment as deciphering Pablo Neruda in Spanish. Perhaps this is the greatest gift Silverstein leaves behind in these writings. A self contained language filled with a meaning and clarity all its own which will be accessed only when you rediscover the precocious, curiosity you brought to the book as a child exploring literature for the first time."

I often compare the story to my current observations about kids and their relationship with their parents...

This is basically a Sneetches with a Christian spin that had both me and my son sitting in silent contemplation and wonder, flippng through the pages and thinking more deeply about that ""mystery which some people call God."" It then prompted a meaningful discussion about popularity, poverty, and conformity. Definitely a thought-provoking read with a title that is sure to keep it unpopular for years to come."

 The story is good - the first 12 chapters especially. 
 One flaw is in setting this in the (nearly?) present day (we are told of computers, T-shirts, etc.). No children in London would be so ignorant of Africa and the differences in cultural customs. If this were, say, the 1950s, I would find that aspect much more believable. London is such a multicultural nexus that even the snootiest boarding school girls would have had encounters with immigrants, children of foreign diplomats, etc. At the very least, the idea of foreign-ness wouldn't be treated with such contempt. This story has a lot of a British Empire feel - which is great, but I wish it were definitively set earlier so that it made sense. 
 I also question the size of the school building - how many corridors can there possibly be for a school of just 200 students? It requires how many escorts in some kind of relay system? Please. 
 Can the scissors on a pocketknife cut through ""very strong chicken wire""? My experience is that the scissors are largely useless. 
 I wasn't thrilled with how every male in the book is a failure. The African kid Simon can't fight his own battles; the Captain can't keep his promises and stand up to his wife; even the deified William can't do his fatherly job properly. 
 The audio is done by a wonderful narrator who moves effortlessly between South African English, African (Shona) English, and posh British and really gives life to the various characters. 
 One oddity: ""I had to fetch you for math,"" ought to have been ""for maths,"" I'm pretty sure. Same thing happens several times. Was this an attempt to Americanize the book? Another example is ""French fries"" instead of chips. And yet there are plenty of British words left unchanged. And we keep getting reminded pounds instead of dollars - why?"

The piece presents nine animals, one teacher, and a group of students, asking each what they see. The brief, declarative response leads the reader to the next page, and the next character. Eric Carle's iconic, slightly abstract illustrations dominate each double-page spread with a principal color (brown bear, red bird, etc.). The pictures themselves demonstrate the careful use of shade variations within the page's color which gives Carle his distinctive style. As the human characters enter the book, their images also become more compositionally complex, culminating in the rainbow of faces on the ""Children, Children"" page. The variety of races evident on this penultimate picture drives home the book's thematic acceptance of diversity which was introduced through the non-judgmental presentation each different animal."

 The Lost Prince by Matt Myklusch was really, really, really, REALLY good. The premise was great. The plot was great and well executed. The main character was great and the perfect blend of awkward teenager and overly confident idiot. 
 But, I have to say the greatest part was (what else) the setting. The pirate ships. The magical island of Zenhala. All of it was very cool, well described and so, so imaginative and wonderful. 
 I also loved all of the backstory that was woven through out the story. All the characters had histories and motives. They had reasons to hate each other or fend for each other. All of the characters were fully fleshed out and great in their own way. 
 I really liked this first book of the Seaborne series. It ended up not quite being what I expected and in many ways that made it even better. I highly recommend you read this book after it is released on April 14th! 
 Mini-Review: The pirate life is the only life that Dean Seabourne has ever known, and he desperately wants out. After attempting escape, Dean is given an ultimatum by the pirate king that ultimately leads him to the mythical island of Zenlhala, whose people believe he is their long lost prince and whose gold he is supposed to steal. This book is fantastic. It is filled with great characters, great adventure and many twists and turns, all set in a very imaginative world. If you like middle grade fantasy or the works of Rick Riordan or Derek Landy, you should definitely read The Lost Prince!"

I was great at spelling. So every Friday, I would go into the little room with the bookshelf and beanbag chair during the spelling test and read, read, read. I read this entire book in those 20-minute increments. When I was done, a male friend of mine in the class found out and put it on the markerboard tray during recess and drew arrows point to it and things like ""DIANA READ THIS!!!!!"" ""GROSS!!"" ""EWWWWWWWW!"" He got in trouble. 
 But I wasn't embarrassed to have read it. I really enjoyed it. What 5th grade girl isn't constantly thinking about friends, boys, and her period? I was. We all were. And Judy Blume delivers. Rereading it as an adult, I'm surprised at how much of this book I completely internalized. The boy with the chartreuse dragon jacket, the girl eating bananas to gain weight, the guy with the translucent eyelashes whose mom was the doctor, getting your first period at the school dance...it's all from the same book! THIS ONE. Whenever I hear the word ""chartreuse,"" I think ""dragon jacket"" to this day. I also think ""Crazy Eddie's"" whenever I see an inexpensive telephone. This book has wormed its way permanantly into my subconscious, much like the TV show Dr. Katz. 
 One thing that I didn't remember was the whole plot with Stephanie's parents getting separated, which was very important. I know she was portrayed as being very immature about her parents' separation, but I found myself cheering her on for giving her parents a hard time. You can't expect your 12-year old to be like, ""Mom, Dad, I fully support you doing whatever you feel like. I'm fine with us not being a family because you got bored with it.""

To make matters worse, her mother suffers from depression; her father is starting a new life with a new wife in California; her older sister Riley is aloof and wrapped up in her music and boyfriend; and the family house is about to go into foreclosure. 
 Overcome with grief on the day of her beloved grandmother's funeral, Tara Doucet is visited by unusually beautiful butterflies that seem to know Tara. By courier, she receives the first of several letters containing keys and clues provided by Granny Claire before her death. The story takes the reader on a curious and dangerous adventure that will unlock the mystery of Granny Claire's life. 
 Beginning at Granny Claire's house in Louisiana, the journey takes Tara and her sister to the islands of Chuuk in Micronesia for the reading of Granny Claire's will. Here is where the magical butterflies abound and the location of Granny's laboratory. Granny Claire names several untrustworthy people that Tara will have to deal with. Tara and her sister eventually open the last lock only to find themselves in a life-threatening situation. The end of the book wraps the story up nicely with life-altering surprises for Tara and her family. This is a mystery containing the elements of love, loss, grief, family, and renewal.

 Winnie Finn is a worm aficionado. Knows all the funky facts about worms. Would like broader recognition of her area of expertise. Starts thinking about the county fair. Realizes that, no, you can't pin a blue ribbon on a worm... but she can get a share of the prize money by helping her friends and neighbors with their projects. She constructs a worm composter out of cast-off items, feeds it with table scraps and chicken poop, and soon has rich worm castings, which she gives to the corn farmer in exchange for corn, which she hands over to the chicken lady in exchange for eggs that she passes along to a dog breeder. All three win prizes and share their winnings with Winnie, who invests in new equipment and is well on her way to becoming a tycoon in the new barter economy. 
 Ard Hoyt's illustrations, are, as usual, lively and fun, with cute details (Winnie's cat is not as enthusiastic about worms as Winnie is). Winnie herself is bright-eyed and tomboyish, but with beads around her neck and a flower on her orange visor.

I, however, wanted more...more about the creatures and how they would be as pets. I really wanted to go further down that road -- at least about having a gryphon! -- but I'm sure the rhyming was quite the limitation on this. The illustrations are fun-lovely.

It appears his grandmother is running a bed and breakfast inn for aliens! While he is understandably scared at the prospect of being surrounded by beings from outer space he quickly learns to accept the situation and even begins helping out. The local sheriff has targeted the inn due to the ""strange"" happenings that seem to follow the guests. What starts off as a campy alien book goes deeper when Scrub learns acceptance, starts to fall in love, and tries to help his grandmother save her business."

Some are common while some are rare. Great pictures with bite sized information just the right amount for most kids to absorb. I like the small size of the book making it easy for kids to handle. As usual with most of Jenkin's books there is additional information about each animal in the back.

The protagonist is a kid who can access this world being terrorized by this witch through his closet door. Now that I am older, I can see shades of Chronicles of Narnia. But it really isn't a knock-off. It was very different and much more scary than Narnia was.

 I realize this book was written by a woman, but was that really normal behavior at the turn of the previous century or did she just have some issues? 
 That's the only major fault I have with the book--I love its sense of hope and goodness and doing the right thing for those we love. And I love Rebecca's independent spirit."

 Nunca me gusto las cinco veces que intente leerlo y tampoco me gusto mucho ahora. Recuerdo que siempre me aburria al cabo de unas veinte paginas, cansada de que Alicia creciera y se achicara a cada rato y se pusiera a llorar. 
 Bebio y se agrando. Comio y se achico. Bebio y se agrando de nuevo. Se abanico y se achico de nuevo. Y de repente la sala ya no estaba y empezaron a salir pajaros y ratones de la nada... wtf. 
 Este libro no tiene ningun sentido. Quizas la conversacion con el gato Cheshire brinde un poco de profundidad a todas estas aventuras, pero nunca se encontrara una explicacion definitiva. Asi que me quedo con eso, con su sin sentido. Quizas a los ninos les guste... Pero yo solo puedo decir que de nina no le encontre nada interesante, ni siquiera a la pelicula de Disney. Lo unico que me intereso en esta ocasion fue todo el tema de la identidad: 
 Me pregunto si habre cambiado de alguna manera durante la noche. Veamos: ?era yo la misma esta manana al levantarme? Casi creo recordar que me sentia algo diferente. Pero si no soy la misma, la pregunta siguientes es: ?quien soy yo? !Ah! !Eso si que es un misterio!"

 An entertaining but formula driven read. I'm envious of the the life that Nancy seemed to lead, driving a blue convertible, doing a few odd jobs for her father and basically wandering around here, there and everywhere. She is fiercely independent and I loved that she could set her hand to tackling thieves, escaping out of a locked cupboard, changing a tyre and fixing a motor boat. Our Nancy is a multi skilled super sleuth and she does it all with twinkling eyes and a cute wardrobe! Go Nancy! 
 It also cracks me up that this book is about a missing will and the name of the book is a spoiler! You need never actually read the book to solve the mystery, just look at the cover and you're good."

Seeing her weird bed and breakfast that seems a little too interested in extraterrestrial life, David is sure that this summer will be the worst ever. What awaits inside is wilder than any nightmare. Behind each door is a portal, where aliens from other planets visit to relax and to learn more about earth. In charge of making sure the aliens won't attract too much attention while visiting, David has to avoid the sheriff, who is suspicious about the bed and breakfast. Will he be able to keep the true identity of the guests a secret, or will his crush on the sheriff's daughter blow the secret? 
 I am using this book with my 5th grade book club, and I love it. The plot is fun. David has one mishap after another, and there are plenty of funny adventures as the aliens try to have a polite dinner, cover up their extra limbs and eyes, and generally cause mayhem around town. 
 The human characters are quirky, the alien friends are weirdly interesting. David's grandmother is a perfect offset of his distant parents, and I love the way her acceptance and love help him mature over the summer. 
 The aliens, while weird, have the same family loyalty and feelings as David, and their common respect drive the theme of the book without lecturing the reader. 
 I'm not a big science fiction fan, but the idea of aliens and life on other planets is done from more of a humorous approach than a sci-fi one. Fans of both genres will enjoy this first book in a ""sure to be a hit"" series."

Our parents would write the check, & our teacher would place the order. A few weeks later, the books would come in & we'd all pass them around the classroom in excitement. I couldn't wait to get home & start reading. 
 One of those books that has stayed with me over the years, traveling from house to house, state to state, was A Taste of Blackberries, a touching story of a boy's friend who dies of a bee sting & how the boy deals with the loss. I'm not sure why this book resonanted with me when I was 12 years old. I hadn't lost any friends & all of my immediate relatives were still alive. Still, I remember treasuring this book as a tween, & I still really like the story, & would recommend it to any kid, whether they've experienced a loss or not."

But when they come across a Halloween party, they are surprised to discover that the monsters and witches are actually children dressed in Halloween costumes. When Bela and Morgan sail off on the witch's broom, it's the children's turn to be surprised! Lisa Brown, a local San Francisco author and illustrator, has captured just the right balance between a dark Halloween night and a sweet vampire boy and young witch. Kids have fun getting the joke that children really do exist. The speech bubbles bring children right into Bela and Morgan's perspective, and the understated prose lets readers discover the tricks for themselves. This is a Halloween treat for young readers."

 I imagine this is what Barbie would be like if she became a detective with a lawyer father. I really enjoyed the plot and I'm glad it wasn't a mystery that I was able to solve through heavy foreshadowing as many mystery stories are. The twist and turns really kept me captivated and wanting to read on. While the ending was pretty predictable, I throughly enjoyed the journey of Nancy Drew's first case. The problems I had with this book are personal qualms as it is a bit unbelievable that certain allowances of Nancy Drew's could have been made had this been a real story. I understand that this book was written in the 1930s and perhaps society was kinder and legal/police authority were more lenient but I found it unrealistic that the police would allow Nancy to take the reins on a case such as this regarding the dangers that she would have to face (and had faced). It was nice to at least see her father vocalizing his worry of her taking actions that would potentially risk her health and safety, mentally or physically. 
 Another personal issue I had with this book was the vagueness and simplicity that characters were described and black/whiteness of certain characteristics. As first approach, Nancy's father is described as ""tall and handsome"" while her friend Helen is described as ""slim and attractive"". When describing characters who are kind, they are often given attractive physical descriptions but with characters who are rude and selfish, they are described as physically lacking. This kind of description can lead young readers to distrust or even mistreat those who are more physically unattractive. I feel that there should be more complexity when building characters, although I can overlook the simplicity of physical descriptions. Despite this, I believe that Nancy is a great role model for children and young readers as a woman who can overcome her obstacles and achieve her goals. I don't recommend going to the same lengths as her and putting oneself in physical danger to attain ones aspirations but I felt that her perseverance, despite her visible show of fear, allowed her to be a strong female character and a great example to young women everywhere. These aspects were seen as a bit annoying to me at first but I admired her for her tact and gumption, something I particularly noticed due to many male authority characters telling her she was not like other girls (as I rolled my eyes). 
 I'm very interested to see how Nancy develops over the course of this series and will most likely pick up some of the other books."

 I've heard people say that the idea for the book came to Carroll while in a drug-induced stupor, and I completely believe it. Its senseless dialogue and lack of a plot are almost as annoying as the character of Alice herself. (Who really talks to themselves that much?) 
 At first glance, it seems that the half-hearted attempt at a fanciful story would appeal to children, but the failed attempt at cunning wordplay would likely confuse younger readers, and annoy any reasonable adult who had the bad fortune of reading it aloud to their children. 
 I'm deleting this drivel from my ereader, not because I need the space, but so I won't have to groan and shake my head over the hours wasted with this book when I'm flipping through my digital library."

All the dolls in the town gave each other star stickers for doing something special, like using big words or having smooth wood and fine paint. They wood give gray dot stickers for those who had chipped paint or other things that they felt undesirable. Punchinello had lots of gray dots and never got any stars. This made him feel bad.

Some stories are bland, boring, just thoughts of this author that, while being good tales on their own, do not have that magic that I believe that fairy tales are supposed to have. If this book consisted only of such stories, I'd give it a 2, as it would be just an ""ok"" book, as the rating suggests. 
 However, when it comes to stories such as ""The Snow Queen"" and ""The Little Mermaid"" this book deserves all the stars Goodreads would allow me to rate it. These stories are the true fairy tales that gave Andersen the status he so rightly deserves. These are ones with true morals, that reach out to your heart and that have the magic and dreams that Disney recaptured so well in the film adaptations. These are the ones that are a must-read and that you certainly cannot miss. 
 However, it is still a must-read book."

 Our heroes, Harold and George, are back and this time they set out to teach the class how to do a ""squishy"". Of course this excites the rest of the class and even Ms. Ribble, who has changed much of her personality due to events from the last book.Unfortunately for everyone in the class is halted by Melvin Sneedly, the school's brainiac, who refuses to let anyone out the door until he has shown off his Combine-O-Tron 2000 during the class's demonstration speech. 
 However, the class is less interested and more interested in heading to the cafeteria for ketchup. This seems to annoy Melvin, who is determined to show off his invention. Once he has had Sulu the hamster undergo a groundbreaking transformation, Melvin proceeds to demonstrat with the hamster but Sulu doesn't obey. Instead, Sulu proceeds to spank Melvin sending Melvin running off in tears. 
 The class celebrates the end and the rest of the class follows after him chanting ""Squishes!"" but not George and Harold. They stay behind with the hamster. They offer to take Sulu home with them and the hamster takes them up on the offer. 
 Mr. Krupp is in a foul mood. He demands coffee from Miss Anthrope, who tells him to get it himself. This seems to only fuel Mr. Krupps mood as he heads to the bathroom. There at the door is Ms. Ribble, who is trying to hold back her laughter until she hears Krupp yell about having ketchup on his underwear. 
 Mr. Krupp heads off to find George and Harold and blames them for the new fad going around the school. Harold, who is sitting at the lunch table with George and several other members of their class, tells him they had nothing to do with it and even another speaks up for them. Unfortunately Melvin takes this moment to stick his nose and tell Mr. Krupp that they had taught the class the prank. Mr. Krupp sends the kids to the detention. 
 While in detention, the two boys create a new comic called ""Captain Underpants and the Terrifying Tale of Tattle-Tron 2000"" with Melvin as the villain character. The class loves it but not Melvin, who is angry at being portrayed by the two boys in their comic that he storms home to invent something that would make him much cooler than George and Harold. It is too bad though that Melvin's allergies (triggered by the cat). As he sets his invention on to become combined with the robot, his allergies make an unfortunate appearance adding to the transformation. 
 The next day, George and Harold bring Sulu to school to show their class what they have taught the hamster. It is during this moment that Melvin enters as a Bionic Booger Boy. From there hilarity ensues as the cold and flu season makes it dreadful appearance. 
 This was another fun read. I had been waiting for quite some time to see Melvin become the next villain of sorts. This time his need for attention and to prove that he can be cooler than George and Harold was his undoing. Instead of taking a moment to think things through, he went and created something that had dire consequences especially since his allergies were acting up. Yet, George and Harold proved once again to be the heroes that Captain Underpants should be and that is the hilarity of it all. This is still their mess and they still have to continue to keep Mr. Krupp from learning what they have done to him. 
 I have really come to love this series. The things these two kids do is funny as hell and there is always some moral lying underneath the rubble of each book."

 Yoon introduces us to a trio of friends, Big Duck, Little Duck and Porcupine. We see them going through a series of adventures, including having a picnic and going to Porcupine's birthday. More often than not, Big Duck is bossy, and it's up to Little Duck to save the day... 
 What's notable about Duck, Duck, Porcupine, is Salina Yoon's gentle focus on Little Duck's day-to-day importance, even if he doesn't speak just yet. He's always the catalyst for each of the short stories; solving problems, pointing out overlooked facts and humorously going along with sister Big Duck's whims, even when both he and the reader know that she's being a bit silly. 
 This is a great reminder and reinforcement on how important a younger sibling can be even if they don't necessarily have the voice or the words to dominate the situation like an older sibling, just yet. Younger readers will likely relate greatly to Little Duck, while also finding humor in the facial expressions of the characters. 
 In terms of writing and art style, Yoon makes it a point of using simple sentences that are easy to grasp and read. Though her art is bolder and simpler than some of her other work, it's a nice way to help the readers focus on both facial expressions, and the overall point of the story. 
 Bottom line: Yoon beautifully advocates for those who may not have the loudest voice, and reminds them of how important they can be. A must-read and a must-have for all readers, full stop."

 Scrub is spending the summer with a grandmother he's never met. Turns out, she runs a B&B catering exclusively to visitors from other planets. Part of her service is giving her guests disguises so that they can tour Earth. 
 It's a fun concept, there's a local setting, a touch of romance, and some funny situations. 
 I wasn't blown away, but I rarely am by books targeting this age group. 
 One complaint: I loved the illustrations aesthetically - in addition to the cover, there are images of aliens at the beginning of each chapter. But I was distracted by the fact that the aliens pictured in the chapter headings (is there a term for those?) do not, in the least, correspond with what's happening in the story, or even with any aliens in the story at all. And a few repeat. So yeah, I found that totally annoying. 
 Also, I don't like that Disney's taking over the world."

In the previous (and first) book in this series, Winston used his puzzle-solving skills to unlock a mystery. In this volume, Winston and his friends are part of a team of students representing their school in a puzzle-solving competition! The winning school will win $50,000. This series does an excellent job of integrating actual reader-solvable puzzles into the story. Included are all kinds of word problems, such as crosswords, word squares, word searches, and some unfamiliar puzzle models. The reader may complete each puzzle as they come to it, and an answer key is included in the back of the book, as well as some extra puzzles for the puzzle-fanatic. Readers may go to a website to print fresh pages to solve the puzzles on if they don't want to mar the book. Berlin succeeds at making a novel interactive. Unfortunately, the writing could use some tuning up. The character relationship complexity pales when compared to books like The Gollywopper Games by Jody Feldman. However books in this genre are rare and this title is highly recommended for puzzle enthusiasts."

Unfortunately, the twins are not identical, and this may destroy Jones' hopes for saving the world. 
 One of the things that struck me most about this book was when Rachel questioned Mr. Jones as to whether she and her brother must destroy the creatures, if it might be possible that the creatures could be reasoned with. That's unusual in a story in this genre.

 Unfortunately, this was not a picture book, so the writing got in the way.

I just can't stand those journey books. The author seems to think as long as the hero sees some cool creatures and has some close scrapes, it shouldn't matter than there's no rising action or climax to speak of. Mindless action. Mindless creature exposition. I'm sure the story would have eventually gotten moving in the other books, but I suppose I'll never find out."

 But the prince learns through his experiences outside the castle that it can be much worse. He returns and kisses his wife (who is still nagging). They both turn into frogs and hop off happily ever after.

 But I do like the ending. A call to action, which is good. What if? It is reminiscent of Lennon's Imagine. What if? indeed. 
 It's a classic Dr. Seuss tale. The rhyming and the cadence are all as expected. The illustrations are as Seuss-like as ever. A fun book, but one with a very pointed message. I'm all for not recklessly cutting down every kind of a species, but did business have to be portrayed as greedy? Lynne Cherry told the same tale in The Great Kapok Tree, but put the onus on a greedy logger, not business in general.

 I can't believe it took me this long to finally get to this story despite having watched the animated and motion picture adaptations countless of times. How the Grinch Stole Christmas! was just as heartwarming as the films, and a picture book I highly recommend to families with children that are a fan of Dr. Seuss. 
 In this story, readers meet the Grinch, a grouchy creature that simply cannot stand Christmas and the idea that the Whos down in Who-ville celebrate and sing on the merry day. So then he comes to a ""wonderful, awful"" idea and devises a plan to steal Christmas. However, he soon realizes it isn't so easy to ruin the Whos cheerful attitude and the joy of Christmas. 
 As you guys know, I don't really read children's books anymore, much less review them. But because I had this oppurtunity to read this classic, I went ""why not?"" 
 After having read it I wasn't sure how I wanted to approach reviewing such a short book. I knew I wanted to stay away from my usual, somewhat lengthy reviews, so I think I'll attempt to do it in a Dr. Seuss-esque style. 
 This book was long, long overdue 
 for me to start 
 but it's never too late to read something new. 
 It was a story that warmed up the heart. 
 Not to mention, 
 Dr. Seuss has a wonderful, unique rhyme scheme 
 it made readers have to pay attention 
 because there were so many tongue twisters it seems. 
 The fantastical creatures 
 and made up characters 
 were the best elements and features. 
 And the adventure! 
 Perfect for all children, I think. 
 And one that readers must read for the holiday season. 
 Now, please, go pick it up, (wink, wink) 
 now that Summer has given you a good reason. 
 Ugh, that was super cheesy. (So sorry!) 
 But in all seriousness, this is a wonderful children's classic. The overall message proves that this is one of those where you're never too old to read. Past all the silliness and tongue twisters, Dr. Seuss reminds us all a very important thing to remember about Christmas and the holiday season. They aren't just about giving and the presents under the tree but rather a time to rejoice with the company of family and friends. 
 So I really hope that for those of you, like me, that skipped this classic as a child decide to pick up this book. It's easily a twenty minute read that will make you smile. And perhaps if you've already read it, it'll inspire you to reminisce about your childhood holiday memories.

Papa, Olivier, and Oma were left behind. Told in a series of letters to her grandmother (Oma), this is a first-person account of a girl trying to fit into a new culture, new country, new language, new everything. She misses people and places, and these Americans are so peculiar! Grandma's urging to find one good thing about America every day is sometimes a stretch. Still Anais perseveres, talking about school, shelters, the search for an apartment, and her fears for her brother and father, left behind. This is a poignant and encouraging look at the life of a refugee, told with humor and, ultimately, hope."

 What can you say about the The Search For The Green Rooster. Honestly I don't know if they could have titled it any better. I believe no other words pop up more than 'fat man' and 'green rooster'. How obsessed Flossie is with finding this animal that in the beginning she is actually accusing every fat man she sees for stealing their green rooster, what ever it could be. I actually found the mystery a little annoying compared to 'In The Mystery Cave'. (But it is a different idea of an mystery.) I would have personally pulled the attention back a little from the green rooster and focus on the more interesting idea of a thief ring stealing from rich homes all over town. 
 In fact Mrs. Bobbsey really annoyed me, She actually let her kids walk around a strange city in Portugal without concern. It might be because I am growing up in the present lifestyle and not 1965 but I wouldn't let my four kids, Spy/listen in on, talk to, or catch/stop a suspected thief. She is so lackadaisical with her concern with where her kids are and what they are doing it's almost comical, if it wasn't so dangerous. (They aren't the Hardy Boys where their father is a detective and ties to the police, their dad runs a lumber yard.) 
 A quick statement because I know I've said it before, but ALL the characters are flat. (Even their unconcerned mother really doesn't have a personality.)(I think only once she acts concerned throughout this book for their welfare.) 
 I am going to say it again. this book is a classic and with all the things that bothers me in the book I still found it OK."

The illustrations are clearly Eric Carle style, which many kids who are fans of his will be attracted to, and the repetitive nature of the story is a great method of helping early readers to identify similar words, as well as to understand the concept of rhyme. The book also provides lessons about colors and different animals, things kids tend to love very much. 
 I do question the blue horse, though. It's humorous, and kind of reminds me of a ""horse of a different color"" (now there's a children's book that should maybe not be read to children, lol), but in my experience it prompts a lot of reaction from the kids, which I suppose is a good thing. ""A blue horse!"" they exclaim, laughing. ""There's no such thing as a blue horse!"" Which makes me happy to know that the kids can realize this, but also makes me wonder if the author included that for that purpose, or if he just couldn't think of any blue animals."

And I was not as turned off by a line in the author profile as I feared I would be. I normally would expect myself to be totally turned off by an author who feels compelled to say she ""begins each day with a cartwheel."" 
 OH PUHLEASE. 
 What saves the books is the simple fact the writer is incredibly talented. A real talent for the original turn of phrase -- the coining of expressions that make you stop and taken notice and realize just how perfectly appropriate they are. 
 The story can be divided into two sections, both of which have their strengths. The first half covers Sophia's time in England with her Guardian Charles. The writer JUST escapes the creepy in detailing the tenderness and intimacy between this older man and young child. That Charles and Sophia are independent, free spirits comes across while rarely crossing into the irritating. 
 The second is when we find Sophia on the rooftops of the title and she meets Mateo, an orphaned boy who lives on his own on the rooftops of Paris. Here the story takes on a ""My Side of The Mountain"" quality where the logistics of life on the rooftops takes over. This is always interesting, and clearly this level of ""world building"" is something the author had to do for herself, but I think too much space and time are devoted to this. 
 The ending, the easily predicted denoument, is rushed and somewhat arbitrary. Sort of feels like the author -- or editor -- said (clapping hands together): ""OK! Time to wrap this up."" And then voila, music is heard, a chase ensues, and Sophia is.... 
 This has the feeling, as well, of having been written as a stand-alone book, but published as the first of a series."

The beginning of the story, which chronicles how our heroine, Sophie, is found as a baby floating in the ocean in a cello case and adopted by the kind-hearted scholar, Charles, was a pure delight. 
 However, once the book became plot driven, with Sophie and Charles going on a journey to find her mother, it lost its magic for me. 
 Also, Rooftoppers ended extremely abruptly. As I neared the final pages, I kept flipping ahead in confusion, thinking, ""the story can't end this soon, can it?"" But yes, Rooftoppers seemed to accelerate to a rollicking conclusion, and then come to an abrupt halt. 
 Perhaps the pacing of the story was a conscious attempt by the author to mimic the theme of racing music. Cello music played double time is actually an important plot point in Rooftoppers. However, even if, interpreted in the most flattering light, the plot pacing was meant to replicate the musical theme, as a reader, I still found it to be unsatisfying. 
 In the end, I felt that the beginning of Rooftoppers reminded me of the important things in life, the idea that love is much more important than acting ""proper"" or ""normal."" But the rest of the book was not much more than a middle-grade, plot-driven, journey story. 
 Despite this, Katherine Rundell is clearly a talented author with a unique voice. I hope that she shares her vision in future novels, and perhaps considers using her sense of whimsy in tales for older readers."

The Disney version is a perfect version of it, taking all the best parts and making them better, and cutting all the long, boring parts. I didn't remember there being so many long, boring parts to the story, but the simple fact of the matter is that there are. Tedious conversations that are all in outdated puns that make no sense anymore. The references and jokes are outdated, and so much of it becomes tiresome. To be perfectly frank: I don't like Alice. She's bratty, rude, and kind of mean. She does all sorts of things that come across as her just being a dick. Hard for me to get behind a protagonist who's a brat. Extra stars, though, for fantastic illustrations."

 The design layout is a big awkward, though the pictures are large and expressive. Some of the rhymes are a bit forced. This book is targeted for children ages three through ten, though I think it will appeal most to the younger end of that range.

His mother lost her job in Orlando so they have moved to his deceased grandmother's old house in rural Alabama. On the first day in school, Joe is confronted by a bully who demands that Joe write his homework assignment. 
 Things go from bad to worse when the tax collector appears and informs them that the property taxes are overdue and the county would be foreclosing. Now they will need to move into his Uncle Mike's house. When Joe goes outside he discovers a fox in the hen house, not any old fox but a talking fox! Joe and Fox become fast friends, but not before Fox causes all sorts of mayhem as Joe desperately tries to think of ways to help his mother, face the bully and maintain his friend relationship with Fox. 
 This fantasy tale is written well with lots of authentic dialogue and humor. Middle- grade students will find lots to love. There are cute cartoon- like drawings of the characters interspersed with the text. Blaze touches on issues important to students in this age group. The tale is an easy read that is under one hundred pages which makes it appealing to reluctant readers. Highly recommended for eight to twelve- year- olds, and adults who are willing to listen to a talking fox."

The girls could not be more different: Hazel is responsible, truthful and obedient, Bess is unrestrained, mischievous and prone to hide the truth. 
 The sisters are trapped in their grandparents home for the summer while their mother helps them clean out the house in preparation for downsizing. Because the girls have no TV and no internet, the opportunity for getting into trouble immediately presents itself. Hazel has been given a book of rules; under no circumstances can they go into the attic. When Hazel consents to play hide and seek with Bess, little Bess runs to hide in the attic. There the girls find some strange books about time travel and a unusual contraption, which Bess promptly decides to sit in. Sure enough, they find themselves back in time. The sisters find themselves in the year 1738 on the lawn of George Washington's boyhood farm. He is a six year old boy. What connection does their time machine have with George? Will the girls be able to find their way back home to the twenty first century? If so, how can they explain what they did to their parents and grandparents? 
 This book is the introduction to a series that promises to hold lots of fun for beginning and early middle grade readers. A house full of secrets, strange grandparents, and two inquisitive and intelligent sisters sound like the beginning of an interesting adventure series for readers in the seven to twelve age group."

After a few false leads, the pair find their way to Bushtail Squirrel.. their prime suspect. But they soon find themselves questioning the evidence. Have they solved the mystery? If not, do our fearless detectives find the culprit? The book has a surprise ending and an important message. 
 Shaw does a wonderful job of portraying the animal characters and their personified emotions. The text is not watered down. Younger children will get the message but may need parental guidance.

 Written by Beatrix Potter, Timeless Reads 
 Many parents and grandparents may have a hardcover edition of the Tales of Beatrix Potter on their bookshelves. If one goes searching for a vintage copy today, you might have some difficulty acquiring one. Timeless Reads has done a magnificent job of putting together most of the Potter stories as well as the classic illustrations both in color and black and white. Now you can take them with you on an electronic device, though I strongly recommend that you read them on a larger, color enabled device. 
 These stories and their lessons are timeless. Most of these tales were originally written at the turn of the twentieth century: in this collection, The Tale of Peter Rabbit written in 1902 is the earliest, while Cecily Parsley's Nursery Rhymes are the most recent penned in 1922. Potter's characters are familiar to children living in many cultures. Examples of the more well-known characters are Peter Rabbit, Benjamin Bunny, Miss Moppet, Jemima Puddle Duck, and the town and country mouse. There are stories featuring the three pigs and those mischievous kittens who cannot be kept in tow by their mother Tabitha. 
 This inexpensive kindle collection is nicely indexed with a Table of Contents that provides an easy reference for finding a particular tale. It is perfect book choice for a bedtime story, to teach a particular lesson, or to comfort a sick child. Younger children will enjoy the soft colors and pencil detail of the illustrations. The longer stories will entertain and teach older children. Adults will enjoy reminiscing with tales from their childhood that can be shared with the next generation. Highly recommended for ANY age."

 The book is set in some nebulous time in the past in London and Paris (the horse drawn carriages and top hats suggest the 1890s/1900s but the dialogue feels more modern than that) and this, as well as the rooftop setting, enigmatic urchins and lost mothers, lends it the air of a fairytale or fable.

The story is about how ""The Night Children"" come out of the shadows when it starts to get dark, so all the children should go inside. During the night they play harmless pranks like tearing the leaves off trees, dancing on the rooftops, stealing slices of the moon etc. When dawn comes, this children wake up and The Night Children hide in the shadows until night comes again. It is told in a poetic form, but I am just not sure if children will understand the story. 
 Thank you Netgalley and Annick Press for the opportunity to read and review this book."

Toby is worried that he will not like his new school at all. He thinks it smells more like ogres and he is lonely. He cannot make friends, but he finds an alien, a mermaid, a dinosaur expert and a pirate. He also does not seem to like his teacher very much When his Mother comes to pick him up he tells her that he did not make friends, but he tells her about all the other creatures and people he met. As the story ends he is waving good-bye to all his new friends. This would be a great book for children starting a new school or a new grade that are feeling apprehensive. Children will find this book very easy to relate to. It has colourful, appealing illustrations which reinforce the text, enhancing its message. Sharing the story with children about to start at school will certainly help and reassure them. 
 Thanks to Netgalley and Lion Hudson Plc for providing me with a digital copy to read and review."

 Cute enough. 8 year old Cam (nee Jennifer) Jansen is having lunch with two boys (how likely is this at that age?*) when one discovers that his chocolate chip cookie is missing from his lunchbox. Who could have stolen it? Cam is not quite fast enough to come up with a solution before Jason runs off to accuse someone else in the lunchroom who has a similar cookie. She does, however, convince Jason with her logic that someone else, very near and dear to him, is the guilty party. 
 I can just see this happening. Well, except for the ""cam"" part where she closes her eyes and says ""Click!"" to remember something. And I had to read the part where Jason tests Cam a couple of times before I understood it. (Sighing,) Jason, I don't see how that proves anything. But it fits in with the theme. 
 And kids who don't eat burned cookies are missing out. Charcoal: good for the digestion! 
 *Okay, at age 8 I had a boyfriend. (Hey, Martin!) For the first and last time. I have no memory of eating lunch with him. I have no memory of eating lunch at that school ever, so maybe I should cut Cam some slack. I do remember snack time in Kindergarten. You brought in a nickel or something, and you got a tiny carton of milk and a quarter of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, 2 or 3 cents of which went into a savings account in your name. This was a brilliant idea, that I didn't opt into because at that age I was a peanut butter purist and eschewed the jellied juice of the grape soggying up my sandwich. And I was told I couldn't just have the milk. So I stopped bringing my nickel. This is just one of many investment mistakes I have made over the years. So, the reason this is burned into my memory is that I had to sit and watch other kids eat. Not Martin, though. He was in the other Kindergarten class that actually napped on mats on the floor. We had to put our heads on our crossed arms on the desk. How I envied those kids. la la la ... Where am I? 
 [Spoiler] How did the dog open AND close the lunchbox??!!"

 A massive earthquake has shifted the geological formations around White Rock, releasing a gas that, though not toxic in itself, bonds to the deadly Bomb's Breath - the residual from the green bombs that destroyed the world in the war. The band of poisonous gas starts dropping, just a few inches a day at first but at an accelerating rate. Once again, twelve-year-old Hope has to use her talents, courage, and willingness to take huge risks in order to save her hometown. 
 The Forbidden Flats effectively expands the world that Peggy Eddleman started to build in Sky Jumpers. As Hope and other citizens of White Rock travel further afield in search of the antidote to the falling Bomb's Breath, they interact with survivors in other settlements and discover new inventions, new perspectives, and new friends. And Hope is able to learn more about her birth family as well. 
 As with the first book in the series, messages about the importance of appreciating different strengths and using your own talents and gifts to the best of your ability shine through. ""What this world needs is people to invent, and people to discover."" Neither ability is pre-eminent; both are needed.

 But is it wrong? 
 Simple messages are picked up by children more easily, and environmentalism is a key message we need to teach our kids. This book is also a book of its time - in the early 1970s the green movement was still very black and white. 
 But reading it I can't stop thinking about the irony of his anti-big-business message. Here is a man, like the Once-ler who started with an idea (Beginner Books or Thneeds) and convinced the world that it needed it. Both were incredibly successful in selling the idea to world. The difference comes in the ending: the Once-ler was destroyed by his short-sighted use of a limited resource, while Dr Seuss shows what a true successful capitalist would really do (either 1. hide the shameful aspects in the third world, or 2. actually develop sustainable business practices). Just imagine the massive forest of Truffula Trees required to produce the more than 200 million books Dr Seuss has sold to date. 
 I suppose the story about the triple-bottom-line success of a modern business just wouldn't make a good Dr Seuss book!"

 So I came to this book with some sceptisim - but it is Christmas time and it was just sitting there on the library shelf! 
 I was pleasantly suprised. The Dr Seuss rhyme and rhythm is there, although it seems not as pronounced as If I Ran The Zoo. The anti-consumerism sentiment was agreeable (after emptying a letterbox full of junkmail!). The storyline was much more complex than the previous Dr Seuss X-man and I have read, it well and truly went over his head (given he doesn't yet understand the idea of Christmas)."

 Twig, the hero, is a human who doesn't fit in with his adopted troll family. He sets out on a journey through the forest and does the unthinkable--strays from the path. What follows is adventure after adventure. Or more like trouble after trouble. He meets all these fascinating and terrifying creatures; most end up being unfriendly, some are kind. It seems like he's always running or being caught or escaping. It's almost non-stop. Each time, he ends up being mysteriously rescued. I thought at first that it was someone good rescuing him, but that's not how it turned out. It's different from what I expected because Twig first learns the consequences of following the lie and the destruction that results. After that, his salvation is even more dramatic and it's resolved very satisfactorily. 
 The book is extremely well written. I could see, hear, feel, and smell everything. The descriptions are masterful. The beautiful as well as the ugly, everything is shown so well. I really like forest settings, so that's an added bonus."

 In I Broke My Trunk!, Elephant broke his trunk, and is explaining how he did it to Piggie. He tells Piggie all the unbelievable things that he had on this trunk. Each experience gets sillier and sillier until the way he broke is trunk is revealed. 
 This is a book for very young children - I read it to a toddler and he enjoyed it. I believe that children, just starting to read, will also enjoy these stories. Of course, parents reading to young kids will probably be entertained as well. 
 Even though they are simple, the illustrations are expressive and will bring a smile to the faces of parents and kids alike. I Broke My Trunk! is a 2012, Theodor Seuss Geisel Honor."

They like to hang out with their friends, play sports, or other activities they enjoy. Life doesn't always turn out the way a child, or an adult for that matter, wants it to. 
 In SIGN OF THE GREEN DRAGON, by Author C. Lee McKenzie, Sam is one of the children whose life is out of control. For six months Sam has been an orphan and lived with his Uncle Jasper. According to Uncle Jasper, the arrangement hasn't worked out, and he's sending Sam to a private boarding school. Not only will Sam lose his home, such as it is, he'll also miss out on playing in the district championship baseball game. Their coach says they have a very good chance to win. 
 With his world falling apart, Sam runs away to the mountains, where he can sleep in a cave, and his friends, Roger and Joey, will bring him what he needs. Then he'll still be there for the game. Sam and his friends don't count on weird things happening , however: a secret room, a chest with a carving of a dragon, and inside the chest a ... I don't want to give anything away, but the boys are in for an adventure they could never have imagined. 
 Author C. Lee McKenzie is a master at creating characters that seem so real the reader finds her/himself hoping they'll succeed in achieving their goals. She even adds a bit of interesting history to the story. The plot keeps the boys, as well as the reader, guessing what will happen next. Just when you think you know all the answers, the author throws in a twist or a surprise, and you think OOPS, I didn't see that coming. Middle grade and tween readers, boys especially, should enjoy following Sam and his friends on their quest to solve an age old mystery. 
 This book is perfect for middle school libraries and classrooms, public libraries, and your own library of course, so you can read the story again. Highly recommended. 
 The author provided me with a copy of this book for my honest review.

Being a city girl, I see them occasionally -and always stop to admire them- but I never really had the chance, nor the will, to ride one. But there is something majestic and special about horses and that is definitely captured in this book. 
 Twelve-year-old Sasha has been moved around in foster care for a very long time. Being taken from family to family, and having very little good experiences with it, has made it hard for her to trust people. However, she does find comfort in horses. So one day she is taken to these really friendly people that have agreed to take her in temporarily. They even have a horse that is a lot like Sasha! Of course Sasha wants to stay, but her social worker already has a new family picked out... 
 The story and setting were very clear from the beginning, but it took a bit of time to warm up to the characters. The more you read and the more lovely characters -the horses, Beth, Joe and eventually Dawn- were introduced, the warmer it all felt. Kingfishers seems to be a wonderful, and somehow very real place. Also, I feel that Sasha's hardship was portrayed in a very realistic manner. 
 When I got closer to the end I couldn't stop myself from continuing and ended up finishing this book in the middle of the night with a tear running down my cheek. I absolutely loved the ending! 
 Anyway, if I had to name one thing that bugged me it would be the repetitive thoughts and actions of Sasha. It makes sense in the story, but as an adult reader it can be a little annoying. Other than that, this is a great book that you can read in very little time and I don't think anyone would regret reading it."

He was recommended to me by one of my students, with a background in many things Russian, because of my penchant for telling stories. I am particularly intrigued by those stories which contain morals or which may be readily adapted to teach some point. 
 As with many fables, the stars are frequently animals. The lessons are clear and the stories are short. The failing here is my own inability to read Russian. Translations can be tricky, or course, since many word choices do not translate well. A pun in one language may be totally untranslatable to another. 
 Save for this one flaw, this was an enjoyable return to the world of fable. It is a pleasant and enjoyable work."

 ""They've put a brassiere on the camel. She wasn't dressed proper, you know. They've put a brassiere on the camel so that her humps wouldn't show. And they're making other respectable plans. They're event insisting the pigs should wear pants. They'll dress up the ducks if we give them the chance since they've put a brassiere on the camel..."" (pg. 166) 
 This collection of poems and drawings was gifted to me fifteen or so years ago and, unfortunately, I never finished reading the whole thing when I fell within the intended audience. I was not a fan of poetry at the time and passed over the book for years. 
 Oh, how I wished I had not. Included in this collection are funny poems, serious poems, and poems featuring the bizarre. The poem asking what happens when you put a brassiere on a camel reminded me of another childhood favorite explaining why animals -- most especially porcupines -- do not wear clothes. 
 And I enjoyed seeing how Silverstein integrated his drawings into his poems. The poem featuring a snake saying 'I love you' comes immediately to mind, but there are others such as ""Rockabye"" and ""Homework Machine"" that complimented the poem in a humorous way. 
 ""Said the little boy, 'Sometimes I drop my spoon'. Said the little old man, 'I do that too'. The little boy whispered, 'I wet my pants'. 'I do that too,' laughed the little old man. Said the boy, 'I often cry'. The old man nodded, 'So do I'. 'But worst of all,' said the boy, 'it seems grown-ups don't pay attention to me'. And he felt the warmth of a wrinkled old hand. 'I know what you mean,' said the little old man."" (pg. 95) 
 Nestled within the collection are poems I probably would have glossed over or been unable to appreciate to the same degree as I can now. Silverstein actually deals with rather serious issues in some of his poems -- my favorite being ""The Little Boy and the Old Man"" (printed above) -- and I love how he is able to converse with his audience on every thing from the serious to the humorous in a witty manner. Should I ever have kids or nieces and nephews, I will be sure to pull this one from the shelf and share it with them before they reach their twenties."

She loves the stories and the illustrations. At 4 she is just starting to read so not ready to read these on her own yet but we love reading them together. 
 Davey the Detective is my favorite of the Bird Brain books we have read. I love his enthusiasm for solving the mystery of the stolen shiny object even if he does get a little ahead of himself at times. Sarah is a fun sidekick with her endless chatter and bubbly personality. Together they learn to follow clues and to not jump to conclusions, to slow down and listen, and to apologize when the situation calls for it. The two friends stick together until the fantastic shiny object is recovered. 
 This book provides several opportunities to talk to my daughter about different life lessons while not hitting the reader over the head with a moral. The story is enjoyable and not preachy. It flows well and is easy to read in one sitting."

When I was a little boy, an English couple, friends of my parents from the time my dad was studying for his Master degree in Animal Nutrition in Newcastle, came to visit them (us) in Mexico, and they brought me a Paddington pillow case. However, it was until very recently that I found out that there was actually a series of books about that funny bear, eating marmalade while seating on his case, at an English train station. So, when my wife and I recently visited England for the first time, getting hold of something Paddington-related was one of our main objectives. I did get a Paddington bear, but I was even more delighted to get hold of the first Paddington book... I even actually ""jumped it ahead"" in my queue of books (or it would have waited at least a year unread). What can I say... I read it on one sit and I was utterly delighted and amazed by Paddington's adventures and antics. 
 [Addenda to my review, after a second reading] 
 I decided to re-read Paddington's adventures before going to see the movie, and I was again charmed and delighted by the troubles that his innocence and misunderstandings put him through, both at the home of his British family, as well as in the world at large. The adventure with the escalator at the underground, and the dissapearing tricks at this birthday party are particularly memorable. Paddington is certainly a British institution, as Stephen Fry once said (and is quoted in the back of the book), but that doesn't prevent his adventures from being enjoyed by people from all over the world."

Think of a cross between Alice in Wonderland, Homer's Odysey, and the darkness of some of the Grimm's fairytales. There was a quest and personal discovery journey, crossed with some freaky stuff going on. Really, I was amazed, at the end, how well everything tied together-that's how random the journey was. 
 I would echo the others, and say this is obviously more for the boys...in fact, thinking back on all the female characters in the book, they're either stereotypically or offensively portrayed. I would say the author has some woman issues! 
 The coolest, coolest part is the illustrations. Wonderfully done, and there's a TON of them. At least one every-other page! They illustrate very well what's going on, which is important in a book where 9 out of 10 creatures the author has made up. 
 Twig has grown up in the Deepwoods-think really scary, monsters you'd never want to run into woods-with the woodtrolls, but has never fit in. He doesn't look like them, and he doesn't have their obsession with sticking to the path. One day his dear mother admits to him that she found him in the forest when he was a baby, and he needs to leave because the SkyPirates are looking for him. She warns him to watch out for the Gloamglozer, the scariest of scary monsters, and sends him on his way. He goes on a journey into the woods, doesn't stick to the path, and quickly learns how smart the woodtrolls are for sticking to the path, because he goes from one bad situation to the next one. 
 Will he make it out alive?? Will he run into the Gloamglozer??? Will the SkyPirates get him???? 
 Well, this is a series, (so I answered the first question-oops!) and I've heard the rest of the series is better, so I think I'll read book #2 and see how it goes!"

 Exploring another's perspective is a good better best thing! It makes you look at your own world in a new way and find new things to appreciate. Anais' perspective was so different for me; it gave me so many terrific things to think about. Funny, sad, angry, uplifting--so many emotions to express in just one tiny book.

 The story was pretty decent and mostly rather well written, especially for a juvenile books. By that, I just mean that most juvenile books don't appeal to me much because the writing is written for a much younger set. I'll definitely recommend this one to my Little. 
 To be honest, the story was definitely a 4 star story. But I had to knock off a star based solely on the repeated misuse of the word ""passed"" for ""past."" It drove me nuts. And especially in a kid's book where the target audience is still learning the rules of grammar."

 It's sweet story about a young bear from Darkest Peru who has a penchant for trouble and anything smothered in marmalade. He is much like Winnie the Pooh, in his talent for getting into sticky spots. 
 I love children's stories like this, so I came to it with a bit of a bias, but I really did enjoy the book. You never know where Paddington is going to end up or what sort of adventure he is going to have! Besides the plot, the narrating was very well done and kept me charmed.

 So before I get started on the review this book is 1 out of 10! So if you are going into this book just know it's for the long haul. 
 Twig is a boy, who lives in the Deepwoods among the Woodtrolls. At the age of 13, his mother decides to tell him about the day of his naming ritual. All Woodtrolls have a naming ritual. Twig knows this story by heart but loves to hear his Mother-Mine tell him again and again. Normally, Taghair the oakelf, the Woodtrolls oracle names all the children, but this time...Twig named himself. After the story Twig's mother Splenda ends the story differently. This time she says that Twig must leave his home and head to a cousins house. But unlike all Woodtrolls who never leave the path, Twig finds himself quite lost. This is when his great adventure begins. 
 So, this book was definitely a great adventure story. Twig finds himself in a pickle over and over again. Everything in the Deepwoods is either dangerous, poisonous, monstrous or life threatening. Basically stay on the path and you most likely will not be eaten and killed. 
 I loved this book until I got to the end. I was shocked to find out what the great and terrible Gloamglozer was and looked like. It kind of made me think was there a deeper message I was supposed to take away then a fun read. I'm not going to say the book was super religious but at the end it kind of hinted. Regardless I loved this book. The writing kept me entertained. Lots of descriptions, funny crazy words. It was like Scuttle from 'The Little Mermaid' named all the characters and different races. If this book was read out loud to kids they would get a big laugh. That being said I think some of the words are little tricky for younger middle grades this is more for 6, 7 and 8th grade I'm guessing. 
 Can't wait to read book 2."

 What first grabbed my interest when it comes to this book is the art work on the cover. 
 That little mouse with a christmas hat and schal was just too cute to pass. 
 And let me tell you, the art work through the whole book is just plain beautiful. 
 This is a story about little mouse and his friends who are preparing a performance for Santa Claus. 
 The story itself is solid and I think many children will enjoy it. 
 I would recommend this book for parents with toddlers, to read it to them in an anticipation of Christmas. 
 I also think it is a great choice for kids who are just learning to read and for kids who are learning English as a foreign language.

 The story itself is cute, about a little boy fox named Argyle who just wants to play outside and yet the wind keeps thwarting his attempts. He tries many times, huffs, puffs and gives up. However, Mother Fox has an idea... 
 It isn't the story that steals the show, though. The illustrations are absolutely stunning and vivid. I could see my son just devour the story visually as well as mentally. The pictures truly kept him engaged. 
 Argyle Fox is a cute book, especially for a bed time read or a new reader. I would definitely recommend it.

 Julie Stiegemeyer 
 The mighty Baobab Tree of Africa, often known as the tree of life. This story takes place in an African village as 2 youngsters travel to the Baobab tree, the meeting place for their village. As they walk they ask 'Who will gather today under the baobab tree? 
 Sometimes the Elders gather, other times the villagers, even young children to see if they can connect their arms around the big tree. 
 Detailed and very descriptive, we are taken right to the African village and walk along on the red-dusty road with Moyo and Japera. Visually pleasing in words and illustrations. Beautiful and meaningful book about one of the most amazing trees God has created!"

His friend Lenny, who knows it is a fake mustache isn't swayed by the mustache power. Lenny tries to stop Casper.

 It was a comical book. Funny inventions and laughs throughout. Good humor and interesting topic. The end was different in that no one is recognized as a hero and there was not glory given to anyone. The book is written for ages 8-12 and that seems very accurate."

Sophie and her unofficial guardian Charles search Paris for her mother before the wicked authorities can take Sophie away to an orphanage. It seemed like an optimistic version of A Series of Unfortunate Events. Most of the action takes place on the rooftops of the city where Sophie is helped by a group of homeless children who live on the roofs. It reminded me of the rooftop scene in Mary Poppins. Sparkling fun.

 So today I decided to tackle two topics at once. April is National Poetry Month, but April 22nd is also Earth Day! So by celebrating both events, I present to my readers Dr. Seuss's The Lorax. I'm sure many of you have seen the animated movie (and if you haven't, you should), but nothing beats the truthfulness of the book. The underlying message here is that we are slowing killing our planet because of economic ""needs."" The Once-ler tells the story of a beautiful town that was absolutely corrupted by society. He begins a business making Thneeds for the town people to wear. Thneeds are in high demand, but use the Truffula trees to make fabric. One by one we see the trees cut down and the poor animals habitats being destroyed. We see the pollution take over because of pure economic greed... 
 What I love about this book is that it was published in 1971. 
 Dr. Seuss saw the issue and took the initiative to voice his opinion. 
 It's 2015, we still haven't grasped the concept of protecting our home. 
 So, I beg you to educate yourselves on the dangers of polluting our beautiful home. Hurry before it's too late."

It is a children's book in the subject matter, but it seems to be meant to be read to small children rather than read with them or read by early readers. There is a twist in that the reader can choose one of two endings (both happy) which is supposed to help children use their imaginations. 
 While the story is fine on all counts (it is a classic, after all), I think it will fail with most children for several reasons. First, for the youngest children and early readers, there are no illustrations. In the hands of a truly engaged adult reader, this might not be a problem, but our little ones have learned to expect lots of illustrations; in fact, in my experience, many children seem to connect first with reading through the illustrations. Second, for early readers, there is just too much vocabulary for most children to read on their own. Third, more advanced readers (2nd-3rd grade) seem to be really focusing on chapter books as an accomplishment; no chapters here, so that sense of achievement is lost. Finally, the optional endings detract, in my opinion, rather than enhance the experience. 
 Is it worthwhile to read ""Snow Queen?"" The answer seems to depend on what you are looking for. A child who reads pretty well and loves fairy tales as opposed to books about TV or movie characters, monsters or junior detectives, might be enticed by this book, but it would not be tops on my list for my grandchildren or the children of friends."

 4.5 stars. The only reason that it got a 4.5 is because it seems as though the ending was left open. Being a creepy middle grade novel leads a lot to be opened about what happened after Robert told his mother about all of the monsters that were there. What happened to Karina, was she able to go home with them. Did they ever find the subs body after the snow melted?

Not so much because I don't have anything new to say - I have my own impressions - but more because what if I didn't like it? Does that make me poorly read or did I just not get what everyone else got? There's a very good chance of the latter no matter what I'm reading, let's just be honest. 
 But that's not that I didn't like Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. I gave it 4 stars as you can plainly see (although you'll see in a minute I actually gave it 3.5, whoops, now the cat's out of the bag). I really enjoyed it, but I didn't love it like I thought I would. 
 What got me sucked into reading this book was the writing. Lewis Carroll takes everything from Alice's perspective, her very young perspective. It's hilarious. The way she sees things is just like you would picture in a child. She looks at everything the way she's learned, but also according to how she's put things together in her young life. 
 Then, she also rambles and ends up on tangents that had me chuckling. You ever start thinking of one thing and suddenly you're at a whole new place and you have no idea how you got there and you can't help but laugh out loud? And then other people look at you weird. It's like that. 
 I do the same, as I'm sure many others do. 
 I'm sure you know the story, I won't bore you with the details, but there are some differences from the movie(s)...at least I think. It's been a while since I've seen any of them and I'll update this once I give the movie another go. 
 I think the thing that brought this book down a peg or two for me was the ending. That's right the ending. Skip this paragraph if you don't wanna go there. But come on Carroll. Really? It was all a dream. I've heard that one before - I'm looking at you Oz. 
 Overall this was a highly enjoyable book and at only 93 pages (and free on Kindle), it's worth a go. Come on, it's a classic.

 This is a lovely story of a bear (unnamed) until he finds the lovely Brown family who names him (Paddington) for the station they find him in and take him in, giving him an allowance, taking him shopping, providing him a place to stay and a comfortable bed with as much marmalade as his little bear-body can handle. He experiences the shop windows and the theater and the fallout from his decisions like a cross between the curious Curious George and someone bumbling their way through life not KNOWING. What's an escalator and why does an elevator feel like you're leaving half your body on the ground floor? 
 I loved the narrative and could easily see how any reader can connect be it children, teens, or adults. 
 Quotes: 
 'It's all right, Mrs Bird,' said Paddington. 'I think I'm going to have a bath. I had an accident with a bun.' 
 [When Paddington gets in trouble] ""Ignorance of the law is no excuse,"" said the inspector, ominously. ""Not in court! Persons are expected to abide by the regulations. It says so."" 
 But to Paddington everything was new, or almost everything, and he liked trying strange things."

The Leaf Man is artistically formed from Fall leaves of all sorts or shades of the season. He has acorn eyes, and a small, round sweet gum tree's fruit (often called a ""gumball"") for his mouth. (You can see him on the cover of the book.) And this book is filled, just filled, with the leaves of a Fall season. 
 ""A Leaf Man's got to go where the wind blows."" ... the refrain that runs throughout this book. The Fall winds grab him to take him on a journey that we know not where and in which direction. A narrator lets us know that ""He left no travel plans."" But he tells us of the many directions which Leaf Man could have been blown while Ms. Ehlert designs this book to take us on those possible journeys. Leaf Man may have sailed over prairies, lakes or rivers, along mountain ranges, over fields and orchards filled with produce ready for harvest, or above the animals of the fields. 
 Each animal, fruit or vegetable is formed from Fall leaves that Ms. Ehlert picked up on her walks through the woods. She then made colored copies of each leaf before they dried out and crumbled so as to capture the beauty and vibrancy of the changing Fall colors. This became her tool for creating the artwork in this delightful book. Across the top of each double page spread is uniquely die-cut paper to outline the scene where Leaf Man may be traveling. The edges are jagged along the mountains, more rounded over prairies and waterways, each page lying atop the next, giving the sense of landscape upon landscape. The page-top edges make the scenes come alive. It looks like the Leaf Man might be right there amidst these scenes of natural beauty. Plus, on the endpapers, Ms. Ehlert has given us a labeled leaf guide of the many types of leaves included in this book. 
 This is a visual feast, and upon reading and/or hearing Leaf Man, children will surely be encouraged to walk through their own woods (should they be blessed to have one nearby). If there is not one in your own backyard, a field trip to an area where there is a Fall season would be warranted. Even here in South Texas where Fall is barely a season, a two or three hour trip to the Texas Hill Country will give enough Fall colors with leaves galore to satisfy a young one.

I adored these precious, delightful stories of sweet, and often mischievous, sentient animals. Miss Potters love for small, delicate creatures transcends off the page and delves deep into the souls and hearts of small and equally delicate young readers. 
 I was just learning to read when I was first exposed to Miss Potters stories. My imagination was in early development and it was up for anything. Miss Potter had that special gift that connected with my imagination in a magical way, taking my heart to places it hadn't yet discovered, tiny worlds of adventure that sparked my love of reading. I will always remember these stories and that special love for animals (that Potter shared with James Herriot, another hard hitter for my 7 year old self) as precious. I will always associate them with innocence. 
 These stories are very meaningful to me for many reasons, nostalgia being one. Still, these words and these stories and these beautiful illustrations had a special relationship with my young ""self."" I met them in a place that I was just beginning to discover. The sentient little bunnies saw, and sensed, the scope of my blossoming imagination. They understood it's workings and its capability before i grew to abandoned them. 
 Adults corrupt imagination with negligence. We betray our creative nature by clouding it with the anxieties and tiny shames of adulthood. The experience of reading a book as an adult is so different than that of a child. It's lost a bit of its magic. We've lost a bit of our magic. Reading as a child is a magical, interactive experience. You touch the illustrations, maybe talk to them. Sometimes the characters talk back to you, sometimes they see deep into your heart. Books become friends, for some of us, and I will always look back on this one as one of my first good friends. <3"

 Other physical traits such as having a bald head, a large nose, a distinctive voice and having a prominent scar on your face are described as being advantageous, depending on the circumstances. The emphasis throughout is that being different is cool and there will always be ways in which those differences will be an advantage. 
 This book has some of the most visually attractive artwork that I have ever seen in a children's book. The colors are very bright and attractive without being so dominant that they would overload the senses of a young child. The text is in short snippets, at most three or four sentences on a page and embedded around the images. The cover art is also very crisp with attractively colored images. 
 Children largely see differences between children but tend to ignore them and consider them inconsequential, but only to a point. That point is often too easily reached and should be avoided if possible. This book won't help children ignore their differences but it will help them keep the mindset that differences are a positive thing. 
 This book was made available for free for review purposes and this review was posted on Amazon."

Simple illustrations allow children to easily identify each landmark and the rhyming section of each page makes for a great read-aloud. Brief questions after each location allow the adult to quickly assess the child's listening or reading comprehension. They can also be used for a child to do a self-assessment. Diverse landmarks were included but there were certainly some that I thought of that could easily be included in a companion book!

In fact, after a nasty fit by the princess, the Frog Prince decided that maybe it would be better if he were still a frog. He ran off to the forest to look for a witch to place a spell on him and return him to his froggy state. On the way, he meets, but is not helped by, various fairy tale witches - the ones from Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, and Hansel and Gretel; he even meets the fairy godmother from Cinderella who manages to turn him into a carriage. After the clocks strike midnight, he returns to his human form, realizes that the Princess does love him and is better than being a carriage. He returns home to her, they kiss, turn into frogs, and hop off happily ever after. 
 Being a fan of The Stinky Cheese Man, I looked forward to reading this book, which was new to me. First off, I loved the paintings! The perspective that they were painted from is unusual and causes you to look at them just a bit longer...and notice other details that the artist included. I think children would enjoy flipping through the pages of this book and enjoying the pictures. As for the story, well, I smiled the whole way through and got a nice surprise at the end. I liked that the Frog Prince ran into witches from other fairy tales. I passed the book on to my husband who enjoyed the fact that the characters both turned into frogs at the end - who says we have to be humans to be happy?!"

 An incredibly sweet feel-good story. I love how the Browns accept Paddington with no questions, and there's really no explanation as to why or how this tiny talking bear from Peru exists. It's not an alternate universe where talking animals are the norm, nor is there any kind of magic that would call talking animals into existence. Paddington is just Paddington, and no one questions the fact that he talks and wears clothes. I love that he's polite and curious about everything, and that his curiosity often leads him into amusing scrapes. I wasn't expecting to love this book so much - it would be a perfect pick-me-up book for sick days from work or school."

 To protect Mia Adam did the unthinkable and leave her alone. 
 When she realize that she was alone without the love of her life and her kids she wanted to give up from living but she couldn't because she have one big reason to keep living. 
 Now that Mia is regain control of her life, Adam is back and want her more then anything. He will do everything for her to forgive him and be able to trust him again.

First of all, it was very well written. I enjoyed the narrator. I enjoyed the (somewhat ridiculous) main mouse. Secondly, I didn't agree with the books portrayal of love and forgiveness. They were portrayed as silly (irrational, ridiculous), and also (oddly enough) as selfish (we should forgive other people because otherwise bitterness will make us more miserable). On the surface this is not necessary untrue. Love and forgiveness are somewhat strange by human standards. And bitterness doesn't do us any good. But ultimately the reason for love and forgiveness don't lie in any humanistic reasoning or justification, because ultimately they do not originate from men but from God. 
 So, an entertaining children's read. Something I would recommend for parents of younger children. But perhaps worth a discussion after you finish it."

 In this sequel, we do not see much of Anne and her children, as the story is centered around a new family, the Merediths. Mr John Meredith is the new Presbyterian pastor in the village and he lives in the manse with his four children Jerry, Faith, Una and Carl, and old aunt Martha, who has taken on the responsibility of ""housekeeping"". 
 The Meredith children are truly loveable, but they are not so well perceived in the eyes of the villagers. Having no mother to bring them up, and a father who is constantly lost in his own world, the youngsters are left to themselves and their young wild hearts often lead them to careless and impulsive acts, highly offensive to the Glen gossipers, but in reality fairly excusable. 
 The Meredith and the Blythe children soon become friends and spend most of their time in their beloved rainbow valley. As the Merediths unconsciously continue to stir the village with scandal, their father meets beautiful, sweet Miss Rosemary West and takes in instant liking to her. As he subtly courts her under the watchful eyes of Rosemary's elder sister, Mary Vance, an interesting personage altogether, puts horrid ideas into Una's head about stepmothers. The children do not particularly wish to have a new mother, but they do want their father happy, and although they are persuaded there is no one like their late mother, Rosemary West might just be the woman Reverend Meredith had been looking for. 
 ""Rainbow Valley"" is mainly enjoyable because of its simplicity, its innocence, its gorgeous details about nature and its light-hearted, although serious fashion. The different emotions are strongly conveyed; you will laugh with the children when they are having fun in Rainbow Valley, cry with them when they are afraid, share their hopes and distresses, and most importantly, feel their innocence and good-will. Anyone who has delighted in the six previous novels of the serie will enjoy this seventh one undoubtedly. It's fun, cute, quick and romantic. 
 My only complaint would be that the romance between John Meredith and Rosemary West might have been further developed and explained... Near the end, after Una goes to have a talk with Rosemary, I think that a scene between her and the minister would have added a lot the enjoyment of the book. It felt like many details were being casted aside, when their romance was actually a central topic in this story. 
 The whole point of the book is that the Merediths definitely need a proper housekeeper, mother and wife, but yet there was but a few short scenes between Mr Meredith and Miss West. 
 Nevertheless, I thoroughly appreciated ""Rainbow Valley"" and strongly recommend it."

Being Danish, I have grown up with all of Hans Christian Andersen's fairytales and ever since I can remember, the animation adaptation of said fairytale always irked me ever so slightly, because of the changes. 
 Well, I'm not going to say another word on that account. 
 Because the Disneyfication of Pinocchio is far, far more wholesome. 
 I barely recognised the story at first. I won't go into details, regardless of whether or not you'd like to read Collodi's book, I don't think that would be helpfull in any way. 
 I'm mostly surprised that the story is so dark, something I didn't expect at all. But I still liked it, even though it wasn't the story I expected it to be. There's so many points to lash onto that I barely know where to begin. 
 Cricket floored me. I was baffled, if you've read the book, you know what I mean. 
 The Blue Fairy on the other hand, I was glad to see so much of and have her play such an important role in Pinocchio's life. 
 I didn't really like Pinocchio though. But I suppose that's to be expected, as he says himself: he's just a puppet, he doesn't have feelings or a heart. 
 I'm giving this 3 stars, because while I anticipated a story like the one in the Disney movie, I was actually quite happy do discover that the book was much more complicated, darker and sometimes just grim in a way. 
 Because that's my favourite kind of fairytales, the grim ones."

To me normal is boring, so I quickly dismissed his parents and not worth having, reminiscent of Matilda's parents in Roald Dahl's classic. 
 The comparisons to Dahl are well founded, as the story brings back to life the horrible adults, Roald Dahl was so famous for creating. The story has the same kind of magic, that Dahl was so good at breathing into his books. There is also that strong sense of good morals and justice being served to those who aren't very nice. I can almost imagineRoald Dahl nodding his head in approval at such a brilliant contrast to his own work. 
 This book really makes you realise that it is perfectly fine to be different from everyone else. You don't have to follow the crowd, you can be yourself and you won't appear abnormal. Your uniqueness makes you special. 
 I loved the way Barnaby would pay it forward for every kind act that came his way. He never took for granted the help he received from others and always went out of his way to return the favour. With each new person he met, he took away valuable lessons which helped him to love who he was. 
 I adored the illustrations within the book, with the postcards being some of my favourites. Oliver Jeffers excellent art work reminded me so much of Quentin Blake's illustrations which were often used with Roald Dahl's books. 
 This really is a timeless and beautiful tale that will find a home among the best loved chidren's classics."

 On a personal level, I was surprised when rereading this to notice how many references there were to walking up and down the various stairways in the 30-floor building. It was a tiny--but insistent--reminder that this building is not accessible for people like me who need elevators to navigate different floors of buildings. I'm starting to have weird feelings about all these fantastic books (fantasy and particularly kids books with fantasy elements) that never feature people with mobility limitations, or any disabilities at all. I keep thinking about Alison Kafer's discussion about how crip identity isn't imagined in the future and ""cures"" are imagined instead. The same feeling lurks in my mind when reading the Harry Potter series so this book is not alone in missing this."

 ""When the taxi pulled up to Grandma's place, I wanted to burrow under the seat and cower in shame. I blinked a few times, but the view didn't get any better. Of all the place my parents had dumped me for a summer, this was the dumpiest. The sign out front said it all: The Intergalactic Bed and Breakfast. The three story Victorian home had at least the potential to be normal, with its white picket fence and rocking chairs on the wraparound porch but no. The house was jet black with huge murals of comets and stars and planets on each side, painted on with what looked like glittery nail polish."" 
 I enjoyed every aspect of this very funny story. Smith has created a wonderful new protagonist in Scrub. I was very impressed that the author cared enough to consider what would be the best diet for the Aliens. Aliens on Vacation will appeal to sci fi , non sci fans and reluctant readers.

Yes, it's a very traditional tale, with dragons, witches, and unicorns, but magic flows very differently here. Gold dust from unicorn horns have incredible powers, whirlpools can lead to safety instead of a bottomless reservoir, and unicorns have telepathy. 
 There were several [what?] moments in the book, but its spirit is infectious. The reading gallops along, and brings a smile to your face. It's never boring or pretentious. 
 This book may have brought out an interesting moral dilemma: are the unicorns immoral for bringing children to danger and refusing to return them before their herd is saved, despite proof of the risk? But that's for adults to ponder; children will laugh instead, and savour this book. I did love this book. I look forward to more from this author."

 It feels obvious to me that this is a book in the grand tradition of Arnold Lobel's Frog and Toad, but I suppose it's not so obvious to people who haven't read those books. I suggest that the uninitiated read Arnold Lobel's classic series, the platinum standard to which all easy readers about friendship are held, to get a full appreciation of the way Salina Yoon evokes the same feeling of close, unconditional friendship in the three episodes that comprise Duck, Duck, Porcupine!. Readers are in for a treat as they meet this new group of pals in search of adventure. 
 Big Duck and Porcupine want to have an outdoor lunch at the start of A Perfect Day for a Picnic, but only Little Duck sees that the picturesque weather might not hold up. A storm is on its way to spoil the ideal afternoon, and only Little Duck is ready with an umbrella to keep the rain off his head as he enjoys the picnic spread. Big Duck and Porcupine are upset that their outing is ruined, but Little Duck isn't as quick as his companions to call it a day. A duckling can find lots of avenues to fun in a rainstorm, and his friends might learn there are activities that can only be done on a rainy afternoon. Our gloomy days can usually be rescued if we spend them with the right kind of friends. 
 Now that we've observed Little Duck to be the silent but sensible member of the trio, I Think I Forgot Something! starts with Big Duck trying to remember why today was supposed to be important. Little Duck serves up reminders with decreasing subtlety, but Big Duck isn't receptive to the clues even as readers piece them together and figure out what Little Duck is trying to tell him. Big Duck remembers at last, and forgets he ever forgot the momentous occasion, leaving Little Duck staring at us in deadpan fashion in the foreground, the comic punctation common to all three stories in the collection. 
 The Campout sees Big Duck preparing to lead his friends on an overnight expedition in the woods, but he refuses to depart before preparing for every possible contingency. Every. Last. One. As night falls and the three have yet to finish packing, Little Duck takes it on himself to get the camping fun going, and soon they're having a good time together under the stars. You don't need everything but the kitchen sink (or including it) to enjoy yourself among friends. 
 Salina Yoon's illustrations are splendid, reminiscent of Caldecott Medalist Eric Rohmann's work, and Duck, Duck, Porcupine!'s low word count doesn't prevent her from creating interesting, well-defined characters, an indispensable attribute of the best easy-reader books. Little Duck's actions give even him a distinct voice, though he speaks not a word. I might well give Duck, Duck, Porcupine! two and a half stars, and I urge fans of Arnold Lobel's Frog and Toad, Mary Blount Christian's Penrod and Griswold, Kate DiCamillo and Alison McGhee's Bink & Gollie, Mo Willems's Elephant & Piggie, or James Howe's Houndsley and Catina to make room in their hearts for another set of easy-reader friends. Duck, Duck, Porcupine! is a guaranteed good time."

The city of Kalamazoo, Michigan generally ""Sounds Like Fun"" to Michigander and outsider alike, but a carnival promises even more fun, and that's what Kayleigh and Andy expect when they get in line one morning outside the carnival's front gate. Beyond the metal latticework they see towering, fast rides, a midway packed with clever games and other amusements, and legions of clowns shuffling from here to there, though none of them bear a particularly cheerful demeanor. Kayleigh and her brother are set to be among the first kids inside the carnival when the gate opens, but Andy's curiosity leads them to a sneak preview of what's to come...a disconcerting glimpse behind the scenes that makes them question if they really want to enter. The clowns (or ""klowns"", as we learn more accurately applies to these particular specimens) milling about on the opposite side of the fence look unfriendly and suspicious, their makeup and wardrobe weird and overdone. But Kayleigh and her younger sibling aren't about to let a few vague warning signs scare them away from enjoying this once-a-year rite of summer...even if they may end up wishing they had. 
 The sights, sounds, and smells of an American carnival are an unmistakably sensuous blend, and most everything seems normal about the place as Kayleigh and Andy explore. Only the strange behavior of the klowns make them uncomfortable, and Andy shakes it off far easier than his sister does. Kayleigh's anxious curiosity brings her to follow some klowns back to their tent, and their actions when alone continue to unsettle her. There's something wrong with these klowns, and she appears to be the only one who recognizes it, placing responsibility for the safety of all the other carnival attendees in her hands. But as Kayleigh observes more of what the klowns are up to, she discovers the danger is worse than she feared, and vacating the carnival grounds without convincing her fellow patrons of the threat would spell disaster: first for Kalamazoo, then the entire world. Racing against a dark scheme perpetrated by the klowns, Kayleigh and her spirited little brother must divert calamity long enough for their sole ally at the carnival to shut down the enemy and free the people from the evil that walks among them. But can a pair of preteens do all that when opposed by an army of ingenious tie-dyed minions? 
 There's notably less grammatical and usage eccentricity in Kreepy Klowns of Kalamazoo than most prior Michigan Chillers, and a spot or two of quality humor shows that author Johnathan Rand has continued to grow as a writer. The tongue-in-cheek meta-reference on page sixty-eight is fun, when Andy tells Kayleigh, ""You've got a pretty wild imagination...You should write books or something...like that kooky guy up north that writes the series of scary books."" I assume the ""kooky guy"" is Johnathan Rand, himself, taking the opportunity to wink at his readers. The lack of a crossword puzzle, word search, trivia section, or author photo gallery in the back of Kreepy Klowns of Kalamazoo--at least, in the copy of the book I read--is conspicuous, after the presence of those features in the first six Michigan Chillers, but several interesting facts about Kalamazoo are worked into the story's opening pages, which functions as a low-key substitute for the trivia section. I would give Kreepy Klowns of Kalamazoo one and a half stars, and I could have almost as easily rounded that rating up. Choosing to set aside any logical deficiencies of the narrative, I look to my Michigan Chillers for a good time, and that I received here, as always. If you're eager for a fun read, you're apt to find what you seek from Johnathan Rand."

When an author comes out with a new series of books that use the same model, usually of two best friends finding their way through several minor adventures, are they not immediately and frequently compared to Arnold Lobel's classic Frog and Toad stories? Along similar storytelling lines, we have Mouse Soup, the witty and entertaining tale of an unlucky mouse captured by a hungry weasel, and how the mouse uses his smarts to effect escape from his carnivorous captive. 
 How can a physically defenseless mouse stop a weasel from having him for supper? He can't. But he can talk him into delaying the meal for a time, if that delay promises a more sumptuous feast than ever. And that is exactly what the mouse proposes: a fuller, more savory meal once he has added a special missing ingredient. What this meal needs to make it ""taste really good"" is a few stories. 
 In Bees and the Mud, a mouse who runs afoul of a bees' nest has to figure out how to ditch his unwanted new black-and-yellow companions when the bees decide they rather like sitting on top of the mouse's head in their fallen hive. Next comes Two Large Stones, which I have no doubt is the best story of the lot. Two heavy stones positioned on a hill, fated to forever only see what's on their side of the hill, begin to wonder what they are missing on the other half. When they enlist the help of a bird to fly over and report back what it sees, the stones are saddened to hear that great cities and castles, majestic mountains and valleys are on the other side, while they are stuck on their own half and can only see grass and flowers. The stones sit in silent misery for a century, pining for the wonder that can never be theirs, until a sudden revelation shows them their situation may not have been at all as they thought. Two Large Stones is as thought-provoking as anything else written by Arnold Lobel, and is almost entirely why I'm giving Mouse Soup two and a half stars, and actually considered rounding that up to three. 
 Following Two Large Stones is a comedic piece about an insomniac mouse whose pleas for the crickets outside her house to tone down their merry night music are repeatedly misunderstood. Humorous results ensue, of course. The final story is The Thorn Bush, about a lady in distress because there's a thorn bush growing up out of her chair. Is there anything she or the policeman she flags down to help her can do to preserve the bush's life, and perhaps make it a more suitable roommate for her? After the last story is told, we again see the weasel preparing to eat the mouse, leading up to the conclusion of the adventure, in which the mouse makes it known that he never had any intention of being eaten by the weasel. 
 Arnold Lobel demonstrates his writing and drawing talent in this book as clearly as ever, and we, in turn, get a nice story that legitimately appeals to readers of any age or interest. Arnold Lobel has always brought together the denizens of the literary world, and I hope his work continues to do so forever."

Time Machine junior novels are different than most gamebooks; because there is only one ending to Secret of the Knights, suspense can't be generated by the threat of death or a failed mission. When the imminence of disaster arises to where it can no longer be averted by natural methods, the worst consequence is that you have to blow your cover as an ordinary person and instantly travel out of the hot spot to a safer time and/or location. But have no fear, you can always then go back slightly further into the past than the moment of crisis you fled, and the slate will have been wiped clean. Since there's no risk of a gruesome end, the story's intrigue derives from the possibility that the bricks you lay so carefully in building toward the solution you seek may all be knocked asunder if you error in choosing the right time to visit, or make decisions based on whim rather than historical fact. Even if you're close to the end of your quest, a blunder or two can knock you pretty far back in the historical narrative, where you'll have to start rebuilding again. This creates suspense with each choice you make, the correct one leading you closer to the end while the wrong move bumps you back aways, so the lack of grizzly endings in no way diminishes the import of your decisions. And unlike some Time Machine books, the structure of time loops and occasional backwards inertia is logically linear in Secret of the Knights. If you make what appears to be the right call, it probably is the right one, and won't send you around and around in dizzying circles that make gameplay more an annoyance than a pleasure. Secret of the Knights is all fun, and gamebook fans will delight in romping through its history to the surprisingly satisfactory conclusion. 
 Your mission: to use the state-of-the-art time machine provided you to travel into the Middle Ages and uncover the secret history behind the origin of the Knights of the Garter and their curious motto, ""Honi soit qui mal y pense."" Are the Knights an Arthurian creation, or did they come about decades or even centuries following the exploits of the historical man known in legend as King Arthur? With only a few rudimentary guidelines to help your investigation, you must choose where to roam within the expanse of history relevant to your mission. But beware, for awful dangers dot this troubled time in European history. There's the Black Plague of 1348, and if you're not careful, you could end up right in the middle of it, surrounded by anguished Britons dropping like flies from a disease they can't comprehend. There's also the dangers of frequent war to consider, and many in charge who won't think twice about grafting you into sudden conflict with their enemies. Perhaps most deadly of all for you in particular is the superstitious mindset of the era. The smallest idiosyncrasies in individuals under the crown's rule are enough to cast suspicion on them for sorcery or witchcraft, so what are they going to think if they catch a glimpse of your time-travel technology? Surely any peasant or royal in possession of his faculties will immediately denounce you as a witch, and while you do have the luxury of instant time travel to fall back on should your life be jeopardized, bailing out of the investigation is not conducive to your completing the mission, to say the least. It can also cause problems if the information trail you're following leads you back to these same time periods. 
 As you bounce between certain decades and centuries in the Middle Ages, possibly going as far back as the 400s A.D., your modern perspective doesn't keep you from making friends in the past, even ones who recognize you from multiple years you have visited. Take advantage of the honest people you meet and remain wary of the duplicitous; as in any time, a good turn is often rewarded by the same, but seething resentment can multiply into treachery just as quickly. If you can prove your good intentions to your friends, and act heroically in the face of danger when they need your help most, you may find becoming a knight doesn't necessarily require long years of training and good luck. The answer to your questions about the Knights of the Garter might be closer than you realize, and finding it could be a specially fulfilling experience, even if it doesn't strike you that way at first. ""How would you feel,"" you say, ""if you went through all sorts of dangers to find something. Then when you found what you were looking for, it wasn't what you thought it was at all?"" But your listener knows exactly how to respond. ""That's the way it is with most knightly quests. The knights of the Round Table spent their lives looking for the Holy Grail, but most of them never found it. It doesn't matter so much what you're searching for as much as how you look for it, what you find along the way, and how much you can help the other people searching."" The words cap the entire book splendidly, a mark of deeper literary value than all but a few gamebooks I've read. Never let yourself forget that it isn't finding a spectacular answer to your mystery that defines whether or not you've succeeded, but the integrity with which you've conducted yourself while pursuing it, and the lives you've affirmed by your presence, even for such a brief time as you were allowed to stay. Knowing you've succeeded in all that is what makes completing this quest so gratifying, and why Secret of the Knights stands above most other literature of its kind. 
 The Time Machine series has a lot going for it. Tangibly, this includes the ""Four Rules of Time Travel"" before each story begins, outlining crucial precepts of minimizing one's ""footprints"" in the time-space continuum, and the ""Data Bank"", which provides every historical fact you'll need to make informed decisions during your travels through time. Even if you're a strong student of history, you should probably read the Data Bank before starting at page one. Another good feature of the Time Machine books is the ""Data File"" at the back, where short clues correlating to specific page numbers offer subtle nudges toward what you should choose to do next. The clues aren't blatantly obvious, and don't reveal anything not already stated in more detail in the Data Bank, so taking a look at the Data File if you're confused may not be a bad idea. I've come to like the Time Machine series, and Secret of the Knights is a solid entry I know I'll want to read again. Nice work, Jim Gasperini."

In joining Elephant and Piggie on their fourteenth adventure together, we see Elephant (Gerald) enter the scene with a bandaged trunk. Naturally, Piggie wants to know just how Gerald broke his trunk, so the unfortunate elephant launches into the ""long, crazy story"" about how he happened to suffer the mishap that has marred his most prominent facial feature. It is, for sure, a crazy story, and probably good for a laugh just about every page or so. 
 The really remarkable thing about I Broke My Trunk! is how much of the story is told through its illustrations. I can't imagine any illustrator of picture books being able to convey more through his or her drawings than Mo Willems. It's very simple artwork, too, but every line and every curve projects an emotion or a comedic setup for what's just ahead on the next page. The book's charm flows from the fact that the expressive illustrations form the heart of the story, and I Broke My Trunk! therefore gets a lot of mileage from a minimum of text. 
 There was talk about I Broke My Trunk! possibly being a triple threat for the Newbery, Caldecott and Geisel awards in 2012, a practically unheard of combination that speaks eloquently to the book's broad appeal. It certainly is an enjoyable story, and a big part of me wants to rate it at two and a half stars. While City Dog, Country Frog is still undoubtedly my favorite among Mo Willems's books, I won't easily forget I Broke My Trunk!, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who has liked the author's other stories."

One might look at this Do-It-Yourself edition of Jeff Kinney's wildly popular series and label it a knockoff merchandise item, but that would be far from accurate. While it's true that the second half of the book is made up of blank pages to allow the owner to use it as his or her own personal journal (not diary, as Greg would remind you!), the first half of the book is comprised of the same kind of brilliant comedic writing that makes the other Diary of a Wimpy Kid books such hilarious and fun reading material. In fact, I might go as far as to say that this book is the funniest of the entire series. We see many more of the cartoon strips written by Greg Heffley, comics centered around Creighton the Cretin, and the man with very red lips and several others, as well. In my mind, the funniest part of the book is the section of questions from Rowley; it absolutely had me in stitches. 
 Another great thing about this book is the questionnaires provided for the reader, on everything ranging from personal likes and dislikes to plans (or predictions) for the future, from the opportunity to write advice from you to your future self, and fill-in-the-blanks tests to discern what you really think about everything and everyone. Of course, now, these questionnaires are very much tongue-in-cheek and often completely facetious, but they will get your mind moving in new and interesting directions, and they are all a lot of fun to do. 
 This book surpassed my expectations by a long shot, and I think that many readers who have passed by it due to the differences between it and the other books in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series should think about giving this one a chance. I am very pleased that I did."

In general, I prefer the original Charlie & Lola picture books that were written by Lauren Child, but this television adaptation is, in my view, just about as good as those Lauren Child originals. 
 The sense of wonder that Lola has in eagerly watching for the appearance of the year's first snow is exciting, and easy to identify with by all of us who have felt similar happiness in waiting for snow. I love the eupeptic joy that is always Lola's voice, and this book is a total delight to read."

 I have been on a great streak of picture book narrative biographies and this is another one. I love how the author so cleverly combined Erdos's story and mathematics without ever overloading the story with numbers. This book is so much fun (and the colorful illustrations add even more playfulness to it) yet teaches so much within its story. What impresses me the most is just how much the book makes you think about math, want to learn more math, and want to play with numbers. Even in book form, Erdos is making math understandable."

 (An almost 5) 
 Summary: Kate, Michael and Emma have been alone for 10 years. Kate's last memory of her mother is as the 3 of them were being taken away; her mother told her to take care of her siblings and that has been the center of Kate's existence since then. And she has done the best she could as the three of them have been shuffled from orphanage to orphanage never really finding home and always wondering why their parents abandoned them. But their newest orphanage is different- there are no other kids, it is run by a mysterious man named Dr. Pym, odd things are happening and it's in a town that seems more dead than alive. And the odd becomes odder when they discover a book, place a picture in it, and travel back 15 years in the past to a time where conflict is at the center of the town. 
 What I Thought: First, I am biased because I listened to the audio book and I love Jim Dale. Anything Jim Dale reads automatically is good. As a friend of mine said on Twitter, I could listen to him read the phone booth. So, back to the book... this book is EPIC! I can't think of much to compare it to, but the adventure is at the same level as Harry Potter, Lightning Thief, Peter & The Starcatchers, Kingdom Keepers, etc. Although a similar adventure-type book, it is a very much unique and stand alone novel. 
 The character building and development in this novel was phenomenal. I really enjoyed the three siblings, they were all very unique, but complete and likable as well. Kate is the responsible one who follows the rules, tries to keep the peace and overall does what she promised her mother. Michael is the scholar and dreamer. He loves dwarves and constantly is writing in his journal. Emma is our rebel, always picking fights and saying exactly what is on her mind. There were also some supporting characters who really made the book come alive such as Gabriel, a man from a nearby village who Emma befriends, and Robbie the dwarf king, who Michael is in awe of. The only character I never felt connected to was the villain, so that may not be a bad thing. 
 The plot development was also pretty flawless and in a book that has time travel, magic, changing pasts and three protagonists, it would have been very easy to become lost, but John Stephens mapped out his plot perfectly and it all comes together (including the end which was just enough conclusion to have closure, but just enough cliff hanger that you must read the sequel). 
 Another plus of this series, is that I believe that it will be loved as a middle grade and a young adult novel. It could easily be classified as both because it is just a pure fantasy adventure that will grip any reader. 
 Snatch of Text: ""The tall man had moved into the glow of a streetlamp and was clearly visible for the first time. To a casual passerby, his appearance would not have inspired much confidence. His overcoat was patched in spots and frayed at the cuffs, he wore an old tweed suit that was missing a button, his white shirt was stained with ink and tobacco, and his tie - this was perhaps the strangest of all - was knotted not once but twice, as if he'd forgotten whether he's tied it and, rather than glancing down to check, had simply tied it again for good measure. His white hair poked out from beneath his hat, and his eyebrows rose from his forehead like great snowy horns, curling over a pair of bent and patched tortoiseshell glasses. All in all, he looked like someone who had gotten dressed int he midst of a whirlwind and, thinking he still looked too presentable, had thrown himself down a flight of stairs."" (p. 3-4)"

 More of a spy than a pirate, young Dean Seaborne is forced to work for the evil pirate king One-Eyed Jack. As an orphan, Seaborne becomes caught between two worlds as he tries to decide whether to continue his pirating ways or side with a beautiful girl from a mythical island. 
 The fast-paced, swashbuckling action will appeal to the tween audience. The addition of a sea dragon will expand the audience to include those who enjoy fantasy elements. The bright book cover and exciting first chapter (our hero almost gets eaten by sharks) will be a draw for reluctant readers. 
 Myklusch knows how to write for the tween crowd. He effectively balances description with dialogue for an engaging story. The vocabulary is rich while still being age-appropriate. The action is non-stop and the characters are also on target for youth readers. This fun adventure at sea is a great starting point for readers who enjoy the imaginative world of pirates. 
 Pirate adventures are a popular sub-genre with endless library promotion possibilities. Plan now for next fall's ""Take Like a Pirate Day"" on September 19th. Check out the website at http://www.talklikeapirate.com. They even have a pirate-to-English translator!

Timeless, visionary, a tale of magic and myth, of hope and depair, it was a dark antidote to the happy Blyton bubble. In Alan Garner's world, reality had teeth and an edgy urban feel. Parts of his world were dark, malevolent and twisted. Primal forces were at work here and there was an impending sense of doom. 
 Having said this, much of the novel has humour and a sense of fun. Many years later, a reader inevitably has a different perspective rereading a favourite novel. It is a tribute to Alan Garner's writing that he can switch from powerful fantastical scenes to humdrum family life in a suburban home of yesteryear - and carry the reader with him. 
 This novel was originally written by Alan Garner in 1965, from his own radio play. It features four young teenage children, David, Nicholas, Helen and Roland, who inadvertently break though the fabric of time and space at a weak point, to find themselves in another universe. The plot moves to and fro between the sprawling city of Manchester, and Gorias, the gateway to Elidor. Elidor is, as it sounds, a magical fantasy world; a world of beauty and goodness, a golden Utopia, as described by one of its inhabitatants, Malebron, but a world which is under threat from evil forces. 
 At the start of the novel, the family is in Manchester, in the process of moving house. The children are therefore left more or less to their own devices. It is a typical gloomy day, and our protagonists go into the city centre, to find something to do to relieve the boredom (and naturally avoid being given jobs to do). A mechanical street map provides a few minutes' diversion, and on impulse they agree to find a road picked apparently at random. 
 From now on the foreboding seems to increase. The children walk along increasingly deserted back streets, parts of the ""slum clearance"", feeling more and more apprehensive as they notice the difference from their own comfortable suburban home. The reader is not sure whether it is the unfamilarity which is putting the children on edge, or something else, something more sinister. There seems to be more squabbling, but then perhaps this is part of the gritty realism of a typical family, rather than the more familiar descriptions in children's literature from the period, of idealised families. The children discover a church in ruins, and an old football. Inevitably during the game which follows, someone kicks the ball through one of the church's remaining windows, and the glass crashes into splinters. From that chilling moment, everything in the children's world changes as they discover the strange, mystical and mysterious world of Elidor, 
 ""Round, and round, his voice went, and through it came a noise. It was low and vibrant, like wind in a chimney. It grew louder, more taut, and the wall blurred, and the floor shook. The noise was in the fabric of the church: it pulsed with sound. Then he heard a heavy door open; and close; and the noise faded away. It was now too still in the church, and the footsteps were moving over the rubble in the passage downstairs. 'Who's that?' said Roland. The footsteps reached the stairs, and began to climb."" 
 As one by one the children are lured through the portal into the twilight world of Elidor, we view this through Roland's eyes, and feel what he feels. Roland is the most sensitive, the one we identify with. He is the one in the group whom nobody else will listen to, but is proved to be right. All the children are sensible and courageous, but only Roland remains clear-thinking and loyal under almost intolerable peer pressure. All the children must make choices and take on responsibilities far beyond anything their parents could understand. And here again is an irresistible tacit assumption made by older children's books, that the adults have closed minds. Adults may be cruel, stupid or risible - mere figures of fun. They may on the other hand be kind and sensible. But they are always, without a doubt, unimaginative and clueless. 
 Alan Garner here has made the parts where the four children are back in the dreary world of Manchester, a welcome relief; amusing sections, probably based on his own experience. Who can remember parties gone to under duress? Or duty visits to friends approved of by parents? Probably quite a few readers will recognise and chuckle at some beautifully drawn cameo roles. The inept but well-meaning father, the long-suffering but patient mother might also raise a smile. The aspirations of the parents in moving to somewhere just outside Manchester, the description of poverty-ridden slums, and post-war bombsites with ongoing demolition still awaiting construction, all set this story firmly within the late 1950's or early 1960's. It was a world and a time where children could go off and play in such places, where children were expected to devise their own amusements for much of the time, where even lower-middle class parents such as these were not overly concerned if the children walked back on their own late at night from a party. 
 There is now a nostalgic element to all of this. At the time it felt realistic - my own childhood sat somewhere between these children's and those in the back-to-back housing which was being cleared away and replaced by highrise tower blocks. I belonged to neither group, but knew children in both. I had discovered Alan Garner for myself and loved his writing. He seemed to speak to me alone. I loved his lyricism, his poetry; the way he could convey the beauty of a sound, an image, something unknown and intangible, and almost indescribable. 
 Yet his was also a grittier world than the cosy reality of most approved children's writers. He had an ""edge"". He had the imagination of C.S. Lewis - but his was a darker, brooding, gutsier world altogether. Think of a pagan version of Narnia, and you're almost there. I read several novels by Alan Garner, but later discovered that after the first four, his reality became increasingly darker than my own. 
 The amusing domestic episodes may come across to a modern young reader as almost historic. The technology seems ancient, from the days before everyone had computers. The talk of mechanical maps, radio signals, the horizontal and vertical holds on the television and the tiny white dot on the television screen getting smaller and smaller as it was turned off. At the time of publication they served to disperse the tension, and also make the reader yearn to be back in the fantasy world of Elidor. Perhaps they still do. 
 Although the children use slang from a bygone age, which may make a modern reader grimace or wince a little, these are no mere simpering characters, but a believable family. In the Watson family as any other, there is competitiveness, quarrelling and minor squabbles. Much of the narrative deals with the children's difficulties with parents and teachers, and the sheer impracticality of concealing their other-world responsibilities from their daily life in Manchester. But Elidor crashes through normality, 
 ""The sound of air being torn like cloth burst on them, a dreadful sound that cracked with the force of lightning, as if the sky had split, and out of it came the noise of galloping hoofs. There was no warning, no approach: the hoofs were there, in the mist, close to the children, just ahead of them, on top of them, furious ... All about them was hoof and mane and foam,"" 
 With writing like that, the readers longs to be back in the world of Elidor. It is a magical land, seen only in glimpses. The powers of evil seem to probe into the dreariness of Manchester, yet there is Elidor, whose very name seems to conjure up light and hope. But Elidor is all but dying, and overrun by evil. It is up to the four children to guard four treasures from the dark forces, but since their true nature is not apparent in their home world, their experience in Elidor becomes more like a dream, a dream which just occasionally bursts through into their comfortable yet ordinary life. 
 The two worlds merge at unexpected times. Roland has strange glimpses - some of which fill him with fear, but of course nobody believes him, and this is a trigger for him to push and push until ultimately the inevitable happens. Roland has personal integrity and responsibility. He knows he cannot be blameless for any terrible events which may be caused by his actions. He is a real hero, not a cardboard figure. But he is the only one in the end to hold to the promise all four made; the only one to stay true to the memory as time passes. He never becomes blind to the sinister portents, picking up ominous signals and clues; vague dark shadows in space, a cryptic design, and a rhyme on an old broken piece of pottery. He never forgets their immensely important task of guarding the treasures. It is Roland alone, who remains constant in his awareness of their destiny, and their part in the struggle to hold back the terrible darkness by fulfilling the prophecy. 
 After a humorous episode in which the children are either excuciatingly bored, or squirming with embarrassment, we become aware that they are in real danger. The tension is cranked up unrelentingly as, pursued by dark forces, they, 
 ""... ran from pool to pool of the street lamps and sometimes they glimpsed a shadow, and sometimes there was a tall silhouette; and there was always too much darkness. When they turned the corner the white fluorescence of the railway station at the end of the road was like a sanctuary. They drove themselves toward its glass and concrete, as if ...danger of spear-edge and shield-rim would be powerless in the neon glare."" 
 And the conclusion of the novel is a masterpiece of terror, leaving the reader wanting more - yet dreading what it might portend. For there is never an easy, happy ending, in a pagan myth. 
 Alan Garner's writing stems from myth and fantasy, but he invariably chooses the darker side of Faery. Two of his natural successors are Philip Pullman and Graham Joyce, although both authors conform to the present taste for longer novels. Philip Pullman has also created an ""other"" universe which does not always adhere to conventional moral precepts. Graham Joyce's novels have a similar pagan feel to Alan Garner's. 
 The origins of this particular novel are from a Welsh folktale, whose title can be translated as ""Elidor and the Golden Ball"". In it, Gerald of Wales, ""Giraldus Cambrensis"", described his 1188 journey across the country in a medieval account, ""Itinerarium Cambriae"", or ""The Itinerary Through Wales"". In the account, Elidor was a priest who, as a boy, was led by dwarfs to a castle of gold. This castle was in a land which, although beautiful, was not illuminated by the full light of the sun. Alan Garner develops this idea, making the golden walls of Gorias contrast with the dull sky in Elidor. 
 Reading the novel resulting from Alan Garner's script, it is possible to envisage how atmospheric the play must have been. The language is almost mystical in parts when read aloud, and with today's opportunities for excellence in cinematic special effects, it seems surprising that it has never been filmed. 
 This time round I listened to the text, and also read it on the page. It still had the magic. Even with 21st century eyes and a great deal more experience, I still found Alan Garner's writing very evocative, imaginative and powerful. And I still found the part when Findhorn finally appears almost unbearably poignant. 
 All things have their note, and will answer to it."

 The Celery Stalks at Midnight is book #3 out of 7 books in the book series: Bunnicula by James Howe. 
 Bunnicula is back in the 3rd installment of the series with The Celery Stalks at Midnight... 
 But not for long Bunnicula has somehow managed to escape out of his cage and with Chester and his imaginative thoughts he thinks that Bunnicula is out roaming through the neighborhood to find more victims to build an army of vampire vegetables. 
 Now Harold, Chester, and Howie are out on a mission to locate Bunnicula and rescue the town from any further troubles. 
 Another short adventure from the Bunnicula gang. I liked Howie as a new addition to the series! I thought that it is funny how Howie refers to Chester the cat as pop and the overall friendship between the three of the Monroe pets. 
 I thought the writing was paced good and James Howe has funny dialogue, story, and plot. 
 I liked the whole Edgar Allen Poe's ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" parody skit by Chester, he's a hoot! 
 I wished the book was a bit longer, it seemed too short with not much plot, maybe if it was longer it would've had more ""meat to it"" as they say. 
 Despite the few cons I'll still be continuing with the series.

 Dr. Seuss' most popular character and story was How the Grinch Stole Christmas!, which is about one of the most grumpy and cranky being you could image hating everything especially Christmas. 
 The small-hearted 53 year old Grinch lives in a cave high up the mountain that looms over Whoville with only his dog Max. This year the Grinch has enough of the holiday merriment noises and decides that he will ruin Christmas for all the Whos down in Whoville if it's the last thing he does, so he comes up with the plan to sneak into Whoville while all are asleep and steal any and everything pertaining to Christmas.. 
 Dr. Seuss is definitely a talented author and artist. He has made dozens of children's books with witty inventive rhyming words, talented illustrations, and unique stories making many families come together and have a good laugh. They are cute and fun and I'll read more in the future, I particularly love the illustrations that Dr. Seuss does in his books. I grew up watching his Tv specials and movies, so reading them as adult I'm a bit more critical to the books with them obviously being more simplified than the movies, but they're still a fun light read. 
 After reading How the Grinch Stole Christmas! Me and my partner watched both the 1966 short version and the 2000 Jim Carey version and we enjoyed both and love watching every year. 
 I can see why people love him so much, Dr. Seuss' long successful career as a hardworking author and artist has earned him the title of the one of the best children's book writer.

I have to say that reading the original makes me appreciate Gregory McGuire's Wicked all the more. I love his creative take on this children's novel. He certainly matured the original text and took liberties with the characters.

c4ccb23db8dee77cd923de30d836afae,160629,fdebbfd106357a425e090dd72bb8cb09,4,I remember loving Paddington books as a child and decided to introduce Paddington to my five year old son. We both laughed at Paddington's adventures. Thoroughly enjoyable.

This swashbuckling first book in the Seaborne series by Matt Myklusch had us gripped from page one. Yep, right from the start, the excitement and thrill had begun. And it didn't end until on the last page. 
 Imagine 13-year old Dean Seaborne, a pirate, er, a spy working for Pirate King One-Eyed Jack. He was taken by the Black Fleet, branded by Scurvy Gill and had worked with the rest of the crew. He longed to have his freedom, he attempted to run for it, but One-Eyed Jack caught him. Soon, he found himself inside a cage, being lowered to the vast ocean, about to be fed to the sharks. Oh dear, there was even the Great White shark with its snappy sharp teeth. 
 One-Eyed Jack spared his life eventually, (thank goodness!) and Dean was tasked to spy on Gentleman Jim Harper of the Reckless fleet., to know why his monthly share was diminishing. After a quite impressive and dramatic act, (stealing a bag of coins right under the Gentleman's nose), Dean earned the respect of the Captain and soon became part of the Pirate Youth. He learned Jim's good-natured ways, his compassion to the needy and strict implementation of the Pirate rules, thanks to Ronan, Jim's first mate and trusted right hand. 
 We were just sad when tragedy befell the Reckless. But when a new stranger arrived and told Dean that he may be the one that Zenhala was waiting for, the tides have turned and more daunting adventures followed Seaborne and the rest of his crew. 
 Waverly was an interesting love interest too, but my kids weren't much impressed with her. I liked, however, that she was free-spirited, courageous and unpredictable. She's a good match for Dean, in my opinion. (Although my kids kept telling me she'd just be on Dean's way.. I tried to keep an open mind, after all, my sons aren't really into girls lately. They insist they're still too young to fall in love. Ha ha ha) 
 Overall, we all agreed that this story was brilliant! Blimey! The book was very hard to put down once we got started. We know there's still a lot in store for Dean and we can't wait to read about it!"

My mom read it to me when I was a kid and every so often, I find myself picking it up again to read it. And every time it makes me cry. It hits so close to home and it reminds me to look to God instead of myself or even others to find my self-worth. It's written so well and the illustrations really fit the story. I think every kid, and even adult, needs to read this book. It feels like a parable, with a story being told to reflect real life in order to effectively convey a message. And effectively it does."

We never get any answers! Why were the police so spectacularly unhelpful? (There's a reason given in the book but it's inadequate and nonsensical.) And then the book introduces a new character and you think you'll get answers now and nope; the book ends a few sentences later. Ridiculous! 
 Also my copy said it would be a good book for readers aged 8-12 and I disagree. I have an 8 year old and this book is more suitable for very mature 9.5 year olds and older. The writing is easy enough, but the themes/subject matter would be better understood by older readers."

Lovely story. I loved reading about someone who's faith cannot be squashed and another whose commitment cannot be denied. Love this guardian who raises a baby with barely any knowledge of the proper way to raise a child. This book felt like a celebration of freedom, independence, and fighting against heavyhanded government influence. From running from child welfare to lifestyles of not-quite homeless people, it is quite the imaginative, beautiful story. It was packed with amazing lines throuhgout the book. I'll just share the first line of the book since I loved it so much: ""On the morning of its first birthday, a baby was found floating in a cello case in the middle of the English Channel."""

 At the beginning of summer Doc asks her Mom if she can go to the wading pool with her toys. Mom says yes and promises to keep an eye on Doc, because children should have a grown-up with them when they swim. 
 Doc and her toys discover a toy mermaid that cannot swim. She gives the mermaid a check-up and eventually the mermaid can swim and dive. 
 This is an excellent book for summer as it emphasizes the need to learn pool rules and how to swim."

It is so unbelievably insightful and makes you open your eyes to our world and how actions have consequences. The Lorax taught me that just because something doesn't speak the same language or isn't of the human species doesn't mean it holds any less value. That is why we all must be Lorax's and speak for those who are not heard.

This is not a non-fiction book designed to teach children about hibernation.

It may introduce the word hibernation to children, but it's just a wonderful sing-songy book to be shared a bed time, or anytime.

 No, but seriously it is christmas and here in Denmark we open our presents the 24th at christmas EVE! 
 So today I am enjoying the rest of the christmas with movies and I saw The Grinch. 
 In Denmark Dr. Seuss is not well known. We have learned about Dr. Seuss thanks to the movies. So when I saw the movie, I wanted to try the book. 
 It is very short, but it is also a children's picture book. I like the rhymes. Normally I stink at getting the rythm of poems, but here I found it easy. I like the pictures - they don't look like that in the movie though, which I think is weird, that the movie isn't authentic. I have the impression that Dr. Seuss' characters is just as holy as Peter Rabbit or so. 
 Well, it is adorable and I understand why it is a classic in America! I do think I will introduce Dr. Seuss to my future children. 
 Well, that was a short review, on a story you already knew.

It's easily up there amongst my favourite children's books on top of the ones that I actually read in my childhood, and Lewis Carroll himself as influenced my own writing thanks to his love of the weird and the whimsical. 
 Alice in Wonderland has a lasting legacy and a long line of happy children who've discovered the classic collection of literary nonsense. I say 'nonsense', but while it can be nonsensical at times it's nonsensical in an enjoyable way, unlike some of the weird stuff that flowed from the pen of William Burroughs.

Now I'm opening like a largest telescope...Good-bye, feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet.... When suddenly thump, thump, the rabbit was still in sight as it turned the corner saying..Oh dear! Oh dear! How late it's getting... ( from the book) 
 And it goes on and on...and on. Of course the plot and the narrative are totally nonsensical but if you let your imagination roam and let yourself fall into its spell you will be transported along with Alice to a magical world with its memorable characters such as Mad Hatter having tea parties, and the terrifying Queen of Hearts threatening to behead everyone. You will meet Cheshire the cat, the turtle, the Duchess, Bill the Lizard, the Mouse, the Dodo, the Lory and Caterpillar and many more weird characters all the while growing and shrinking from drinking lotions and potions saying ""Drink me"". Ultimately you will move around very fast and achieve nothing...till you wake up and realize this was all but a dream... 
 This adventure has inspired numerous comic books, films, TV movies through countless adaptations and hundreds of editions of the book throughout the years. This story was one of the freebees on my e-reader so I decided to give it a go. Early in I missed the visual aspect I have always associated with Alice, but as my imagination kicked in and the characters came alive, it became easier to understand the humour and wits that played within the words and admit it was a refreshing experience. However my fondest memories take me back to the animated version created by the late Walter Disney and his Studios. Who ever said a picture is worth a thousand words really knew how to leave a lasting impression in a little girl's mind."

 Overall, the story is interesting and enjoyable. Do I wish there was more to it? Absolutely. I think this idea could have been fleshed out into a longer novel. I think had it been written today, it would be a much longer story. 
 I actually enjoyed the ending as well. I know many people debate on it. I feel as though making that call would be tough. Living forever seems like an amazing idea. I mean, you'd have time to do everything you wanted. However, it would be hard to watch those you know and love die while you still live. Both sides definitely have their pros and cons."

Without the money, she will be too poor to see a doctor, but little Tashi is too small to take her place amongst the tea bushes. What can Tashi do? What will become of them? 
 Tashi has befriended the wild monkeys who are hated by the workers and Overseer, who daily beats a tin pot to drive them away. She is so upset that she shares both her lunch and her fears with the largest male, Rajah. She is dismayed when the monkeys take her precious basket and disappear into the mountains, so dismayed that she falls into an exhausted sleep amongst the youngest animals. 
 She awakens when the basket is returned, filled with leaves ""the color of emeralds and spangled with tiny droplets of water so the basket seem(s) full of green light."" The Royal Tea Taster, whose mustache is ""like a spread of showy wings,"" is so delighted by the little girl's basket of cloud tea that he gives her a silk pouch with enough gold coins for the doctor her mother needs. 
 Each year thereafter, Tashi and her mother fill the basket with delicious fruit for the monkeys, and each year the monkeys fill the basket with ""the magical green glow of cloud tea."" 
 Even without my lifelong enchantment with tea and its tales, I would have loved this book for its sensitive, gentle, witty prose, its drawings and coloured illustrations, and its aura of antiquity. According to the authors' note, ""Cloud Tea Monkeys is set in the past, but you can still buy 'monkey-picked tea,' though whether or not it is really picked by monkeys is another story again...""

My experience with Paddington as a child was limited to the wonderful cartoon, which used to play on the early Disney Channel. If you're not familiar with the Paddington cartoon, you really must find it! the people are hand drawn, with minimal colors, while Paddington stands out as an actual stuffed bear. It looks exactly like the original illustrations! 
 But of course I promised my kids I would get the first book and read it to them, and so I have! What a delight, too! Each chapter is really a short story about one of Paddington's adventures. They're all just the right length of time for an evening's reading session, with a few pen-and-ink drawings. So charming! The stories are all quite timeless, so there's no need to explain anything and the kids don't think it's old-fashioned. It's a bear at the seaside! A bear shopping for a new coat!

 196 pages. 
 Looking at this book's endpages, for the first time ever, I find myself wishing I could grow a mustache. I suppose this is the purpose of having a fake one. Although, I wouldn't pay 129.99 for a handlebar mustache...or any mustache. 
 Appetizer: Seventh grader Leny Flem Jr. saved the world. Fake Mustache is the story of how that happened. It began with Casper's birthday and him receiving money from his Grandma. He and Leny go to Sven's Fair Price Store and to Chauncey's Big & Small, Short & Tall to buy a fake handlebar mustache and a man-about-town suit where Chauncey spends, spends, spends. 
 Soon after, a series of bank robberies occur. The robber is a ""short, well-dressed man-about-town sporting a spectacular handlebar mustache"" (p. 27). Leny can't help but suspect his best friend. But soon enough, the situation escalates and Leny realizes his best friend is a mad, genius, criminal mastermind who can only be stopped with the help of a child TV star named Jodie O'Rodeo. 
 As with Angleberger's Origami Yoda series, Fake Mustache uses short chapters and humor to entertain readers from ages seven to 11-ish. The humor is very fun and off the wall. (It kind of felt like Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians for a slightly younger crowd). Plus, it would be a great book to graduate fans of the Captain Underpants series to. But even more than that, I was reminded of the Sideways Stories from Wayside School series. While I would argue that, like Sachar, Angleberger's story felt a little too rushed or silly, it also captured Sachar's sense of the absurd. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that Angleberger that is a new King of the Absurd. Feel free to quote me on that. And although the book felt a little too silly for adult-me, I imagine I would have loved it when I was in the third grade. 
 And there is a lot to love: Kids saving the world, disguising themselves as adults, librarians, mimes, plumbers, accordion players, politicians and bank robberies. AND FAKE MUSTACHES! 
 Although mainly told from Lenny's point of view, a portion of the story (starting around page 120) is also told from Jodie O'Rodeo's, a tough, horse-riding, former celebrity. I liked this choice, particularly because in the case of young male readers who may be reluctant to read from a girl's perspective, that far into the story they should already be invested so they'll give Jodie more of a chance. 
 There's also a large portion of the story during which Lenny must disguise himself as a girl. While this is mainly intended to be humorous there's also a possibility for this to be interpreted as empowering for the right child (and not nearly as didactic as a book like My Princess Boy) when Lenny first asks a store owner if he can change into a costume: 
 ""Hey...uh...do you mind if I use the changing room?""""For the costume? I thought it was for your sister.""""Well, no, it's for me, actually.""""Follow your dreams! Never stop dreaming!"" Sven sang out. (p. 60) 
 Although most likely a book read solely to amuse, there are some aspects that relate to politics and voting, making this a nice read aloud for the end of October or start of November. (Many of the events also occur on Halloween.) There's also a short parody of the Government bailouts on p. 82. Fake Mustache also includes a lot of great vocabular: superlative, hirsute, deterrent, etc. Plus, when the novel is narrated from Jodie's point of view, she describes how upsetting it is to receive mean messages in emails or on Facebook and twitter, lending the book to a brief talk about cyber bullying (pp. 119-120). 
 Dinner Conversation: 
 ""You may remember seeing me on TV when Jodie O'Rodeo saved the world. I was that nerdy guy in the background that nobody could figure out what he was doing there. But nobody really cared because Jodie O'Rodeo had just saved the world. Remember? 
 Well, that was me, Lenny Flem Jr., and believe it or not, I saved the world too. Me and Jodie saved the world together. And this is the story of how we did it."" (p. 2) 
 ""My dad dropped me off at Casper's and made me promise to phone him to pick me up instead of trying to walk home. ""Remember, there's a made genius criminal mastermind on the loose, and you never know where he might be,"" he said. 
 Actually, I was fairly sure that I DID know where the mad genius criminal mastermind was, but I didn't tell Dad that."" (p. 34) 
 ""That's when our front door was knocked open by a battering ram and fast-food restaurant employees burst through, pointing at me and yelling, 'There he is! The Evil One! Grab him!'"" (p. 45) 
 ""That gave me two options: I could hide in the woods, where I wouldn't have to worry about anybody, except maybe brainwashed forest rangers. 
 Or I could do what Casper had done and get a disguise. A disguise would allow me to keep an eye on things and try to figure out what Casper was up to. I mean, if I went off and hid in the woods, there would be no one to stop him from doing whatever it was he was doing."" (p. 54) 
 ""But my favorite part was when he warned us of the Evil One, a desperate bank-robbing criminal mastermind who is living in Hairsprinkle disguised as a boy named Lenny."" 
 ""It's terrifying to think the Evil One may be in Hairspinkle right now!"" 
 ""It sure is,"" I said. 
 I couldn't believe it! Fako Mustacho--I mean, Casper--had somehow convinced everybody that I was the bank-robbing bad guy, not him, even though he was the one with the mustache!"" (p. 64) 
 ""Hey, everybody, it's me, Jodie O'Rodeo. 
 This whole thing is pretty crazy, huh? I mean, if this was the plot to an episode of The Jodie O'Rodeo Showdeo, you'd be like, ""Jodie's totally lost it."" 
 Well, hold on, because it's about to get all jacked up like you wouldn't believe!"" (p. 116)"

 As the title implies, this alphabet picturebook features 26 misbehaving baddies. The rhyming and playful nature of the poems lend a person (read: me) to imagine he or she is the narrator on the show Gossip Girl, reporting what bad deeds Chuck Bass has done this week. 
 While all of the poems feature alliteration of that page's particular letter, not all of the poems include poetic justice. I personally found this less than ideal. ""Let them have it,"" I thinks. 
 The illustrations are fun and interesting--a mix of colorful sketches and photographs. 
 Activities to do with the book: 
 Students could come up with the own poems of children behaving badly. They could also turn the poems into skits and have a classmate narrate the poems. 
 Favorite Quotes: 
 ""Abby's apt to argue anytime and anyplace. 
 She'll argue over apricots, an acorn, or an ace. 
 She'll argue with an astronaut, an artist, or a waiter. 
 A shame she had to argue with that awful alligator."" 
 ""It's quirky how Quincy is so quick to fight. 
 He quarrels with all, convinced he is right. 
 He quibbles with teachers, then quacks, ""How absurd!"" 
 He quizzes his classmates, then mocks every word. 
 When warned of the quicksand, he questions the scout. 
 He might quarrel less...if he's ever pulled out.""

 I feel dual purpose books are very effective and are appropriate for many different genres. The idea of entertaining several different levels of maturity at once is something that children's cartoons have been doing forever. If you've ever sat through a Disney movie as an adult, you will notice that young children laugh at different things than the adults do. 
 In a similar way, a book can also appeal to multiple audiences. The Boy Who Loved Math: the improbably life of Paul Erdos is a picture book that has a first/second grade reading level and is meant to appeal to lower elementary age children. The text and style of illustrations tell the story of a quirky boy who loved math, but had difficulties in most other areas of life. Children will love the part of the story where he learns to butter his bread as an adult. 
 The author and illustrator haven't just created a picture book for elementary age readers, however. The many pages of author and illustrator notes in the back add depth to the book and make it usable up through high school. It is almost like solving a puzzle to go back through the illustrations and locate all the different types of prime numbers that have been included. 
 By appealing to multiple age levels, The Boy Who Loved Math is a book that can be used to share interests between adults and children. I feel that the wider a book can be read and shared, the longer life and greater impact that book will have. What is impressive about The Boy Who Loved Math is that there are not many books about famous mathematicians. Most don't make for very interesting stories. 
 The Boy Who Loved Math was nominated for a 2015-2016 Young Hoosier Book Award. I am guessing that this book was probably nominated by an adult who felt this was a worthwhile book for children. Most children would not seek this book out on their own. By appealing to a wide audience, this book was nominated for an award and was seen by a larger audience than it would have if the illustrations and back notes were not as extensive."

 A child gets a hamster for a pet and finds that all he does is eat, sleep, and hide. Not a very exciting pet. She envisions a host of mythological pets that would be much more fun -- a unicorn, hippogriff, kraken, Sasquatch, etc. Even though each one seems more exciting than a hamster, they have different reasons they wouldn't make a good pet. Finally she realizes that she and her hamster have each other, and that makes him the perfect pet. 
 The illustrations are colorful, fanciful and make a good accompaniment to the rhyming text. This would make a fun read-aloud with young children."

 If you heard a lot of ""don't"", ""go away"" and ""you're too little""... 
 If you felt left out, left behind, or pushed aside....this is your book. 
 Mary-Mary is the youngest of five siblings. All their names start with the letter M (a trend I personally abominate, but that's just by the way). There's Mervyn and Marion and Megan and Martin and Mary--they call her ""Mary-Mary"" because they're always scolding her for one silly reason or another. None of the older kids have any time for Mary-Mary; ""they know everything and she doesn't know much at all."" Or so they tell her. 
 Nothing daunted, Mary-Mary goes her own way. She never cries or pitches a fit, or even runs to Mummy to wail, ""It's not fair!"" When they say ""don't do that"", she does it. If they say ""go away,"" she follows close on their heels. When they say, ""You're too little"", she proves them wrong. I wish I had known her when I was growing up! She's not a brat, not a snot-nose--just an independent, quite intelligent kid who knows her own worth. 
 Written in the 1950s, this book of short tales (Mary-Mary Stories and More Mary-Mary) is set in a quieter, gentler England where threepence would buy you an ice lolly and little kids could visit their neighbours unannounced and feel safe and welcome. They have both parents, but Father never appears; though Mother stays in the background, she is clearly on Mary's side. Each chapter is a bite-size tale, with no cringe-making silliness on the part of either children or adults. I would recommend it as a read-aloud for children Mary's age, 4-5."

Also, she has string-straight brown hair, and prefers boy games to dolls and playing house. Her parents have real life problems: Dad loses his job, Mum has to give up the sixties lifestyle of earlier books and go to work to make ends meet. Things are tight, for months, as not only does Dad have to really look for work (instead of leaving a job because he dislikes it) but has to get used to helping out around the house because Mum's out breadwinning. Beezus is no longer ""little Miss Perfect""; Mum says she's ""at a difficult age""--see also, adolescent/pubescent/starting to rebel just a bit. No mention of puberty as such, but it's there! 
 When I stumbled across a friend's cache of Cleary's children's novels I decided to revisit Klickitat Street (which I discover really exists). What was my surprise to discover that not only have the original illustrations been replaced (why?), but the text must also have been edited a posteriori. The book was published in 1977, and yet this edition mentioned Gummy Bears--something that never saw the light of day in the US until 1982. Why was it necessary to edit that in, I wonder? No one would consider (I hope) editing other children's classics to include modern products and cellphones, and yet the publishers decided to commit an unnecessary anachronism or two, which adds nothing to the text.

The illustrations are very real and feels that the children are by the actual sites. a lovely read where parent can child bond and read together, parents will also learn as they read to their children. Fun and informative. 
 This is the reason these particular destinations were chosen at the time of writing my book:- 
 This very bright, crispy, morning while sitting on our back yard balcony in the warm lovely sun shining day drinking my Greek coffee, with the birds happily singing and chirping in the back round, my thoughts took me back to the time that I started writing our children's book "" My First Travel Book "" what was it in my heart at that particular moment to choose these lovely destinations that Captain Frankie flies to. 
 Our beautiful loved home we lived and grew up in, Zimbabwe with her mighty, thunderous water of wonder ' Victoria Falls ' 
 Our land Africa where we grew up in with its wonderful wild animals and life, its stillness of natural beauty, its primitive people. 
 My country of birth and culture Greece with its ancient land mark of the ' Acropolis ' 
 Our now country of residence USA, the country of freedom, where the opportunity for Captain Fankie was given to take up the love of his life and career, aeronautics/pilot with her amazingly huge land mark ' The Statue of Liberty ' 
 The land of Canada where our two sons were given their opportunities to reside in with the mighty curtain of water so very powerful ' The Niagara Falls '. 
 The ' Eiffel Tower ' where the beginning of our two sons Canadian future paths began. 
 This is the ""beautiful bright sun shining light"" that suddenly shone in my heart on this wonderful morning that took me back to think of that particular moment of our angelic flights and choices of destinations in our children's book with Captain Frankie. 
 THERE IS ALWAYS A STORY TO BE TOLD BEHIND EVERY CREATION IN LIFE. 
 Let us take a deep look into the bottom of our happy hearts our inner selves and know that we all have HAPPY, wonderful, thankful, mysterious, worthwhile stories to tell our family, friends, the world , to all of our children in our world, always with such happy endings, always seeking more and more happy, fun adventures to travel to in our beautiful world."

 ""The introduction to Lewis Carroll's (I read the Collins Classic edition) Alice's Adventures in Wonderland calls it 'literary nonsense.' I've never been one for abstract art--in any form--so whether or not I subjectively made more out of Carroll's short tale than was really there is up for debate. It seems that there is more to Alice than some suggest and calling it 'nonsense' might be a little simplistic. 
 Don't get me wrong, the book is bizarre. The characters--some of them well-known now thanks to several films--have a short presence in the story and most of them come back around at the trial before the King and Queen of Hearts. All of the characters are memorable, even if it is for their oddities. The thing I enjoyed most about them, however, was the dialogue that is exchanged between many of the characters and Alice. There are many quotes that can be easily plucked from the pages and applied in interesting ways to everyday life, business, family, etc. 
 I enjoyed Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. It certainly is bizarre and it might be a little bit of nonsense. Yet, one can easily use a subjective and attentive eye to cull various meanings and applications that make the story worth the time. And even if you don't, traveling into the wackiness of Wonderland is a good deal of fun.""

 The Sleeper and the Spindle 
 and Hansel and Gretel, after a run of bad experiences with his books, encouraged me to try another. 
 But I made a mistake. 
 I went in with expectations. 
 As someone with hayfever who has to suffer through the annual sneezing season, I thought this might address the anxieties children might have about it, like I did. I dreaded periodically interrupting my teachers with my deafeningly loud sneezing fits. Self-consciousness led me to devise a way to blow air out of my mouth at Formula One speeds in a quieter manner, while desperately trying to stifle any followups. 
 Singing, one of my favourite activities, was impossible in summer. Break times were hell. We were always forced out onto the grassy fields - the home of the pesky pollen spore - instead of the perfectly acceptable concrete playgrounds. Teachers who liked to teach outside on particularly warm summer days were glared at with unspoken hatred. 
 Gaiman addressed none of this. Instead he exaggerated the effect of the sneeze. At least sneezes don't literally blow people away, he seems to say. That would be really bad. 
 Most of the picture books I read - like 
 It's a Book 
 , 
 And Tango Makes Three 
 , and 
 Love You Forever 
 - are ones with more humour or meaning. 
 Chu's Day 
 in comparison was a one-liner, a one-trick pony which wasn't particularly funny. I'm sorry, I'm not used to that so I'm a little disappointed. 
 Adam Rex's illustrations, on the other hand, I loved. A broad array of dozens of anthropormorphized animals kept me entertained as I challenged myself to identify them all. Not always an easy task with a tapir, a platypus and a Japanese macaque among them."

When his attempt at scaring her with a pumpkin-headed figure only gives her a way to test her Dust of Life, it still means that she decides to turn him to a statue as too much trouble. He takes Jack Pumpkin-Head with him, and steals the Dust of Life, so they end up bringing a saw-horse to life as well as they head to the Emerald City. 
 The rest involves any army -- two armies -- of girls, Mombi's abilities to make the road bewildering, sunflowers, a Highly Magnified bug, wishing pills, Glinda's refusal to restore the Scarecrow to the throne, an interpreter, and more."

That's kind of odd too, when I think about it, because I was the right age to be the prime audience when a lot of his books were coming out but I was largely oblivious to them. (Yep. Dated myself. Don't care.) 
 However, as I have learned in the past, audio often breaks open a book or author who I didn't find congenial in print. It was that way with Coraline by Neil Gaiman. It was that way with the last half of The Lord of the Rings (yes, I am ashamed but I will not lie). And, now, it is that way with Roald Dahl. 
 The Twits are the most horrible couple in the world and quite hateful to each other, until they are under attack from a common enemy. Even then they are horrible which makes it quite gratifying to see them get their comeuppance from the Muggle-Wump monkey family and the Roly Poly bird. This story had the most disgusting description of a beard I have ever encountered. Even while I was grimacing, I was also laughing because Dahl had such a clever way with words. Narrator Richard Ayoade had a lovely, calm British narration style that didn't preclude hilarious, low-class voices for the Twits. First class stuff. 
 The Minpins has the most perfect monster name I've ever heard -- The Gruncher, a fire-breathing, boy eating creature in Sin Forest. It sends Billy right up a tree where he meets the Minpins and they form an ingenious alliance to deal with their common foe. Bill Bailey narrated this with a great deal of gusto which didn't detract in the least from the story. 
 The Magic Finger was my favorite story, partially because Kate Winslet's narration won me over from the very beginning. I also just couldn't resist the little girl who ""puts my Magic Finger"" on those who displease her. The Greggs are worthy of a magic finger punishment because they are such keen hunters. What the Magic Finger does is typical Dahl ingenuity at its best. 
 All three of these are little stories but each is a gem which children would love. Heck, I liked them quite a bit myself and, as I have revealed, I am far past the age of tender youth. I am now going to look for more Roald Dahl in audio, possibly even revisiting Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. 
 I got this Roald Dahl sampler courtesy of SFFaudio."

But I love how Dr. Seuss invents words and how his works are written in rhyme. They are melodic and endearing, and the Lorax is about taking care of the nature, and how business is not all in the world. I was curious about this book because I have seen the movie and I like it a lot. As the others of Dr. Seuss, the story is just a moment in time with no background or future information, and without much telling of the characters. We never get to see the Once-ler or get to know the boy's name or to how many has the Once-ler told the story, neither is clear why is the seed given only to him. But it is a good story for kids to learn that a clean environment means creatures to live and clean air to breath.

 The Grinch is lovely because of the rhyme, I can even remember from time to time what is next, because I've seen several versions of this book. 
 The story as such is quite simple and do not explain much about Whoville or the characters as such. It is a retelling of a single situation that occurred to the character of the Grinch, who depises Christmas because his heart is two sizes smaller than any other. He decides to steal what he believes that makes Christmas: decorations, dinner and gifts. But turns out that whoville still sings and celebrate without those items, which makes the Grinch reconsider what Christmas may mean. 
 I always find it difficult to explain Christmas without religion, and I believe that there lies the flaws of this story, does not mention where Christmas comes and why is it celebrated, and then it becomes hollow and superficial. Still, Dr. Seuss is lovely."

We wind up cheering for Earl every time he succeeds in dragging Bobo off in his mouth. 
 This is such a great book for story time because it's short enough to get through in an hour, the pictures complement the spare prose yet they tell their own story so there's something to talk about with the children. It's a great springboard for talking about points of view, because the boy is the only one who speaks and yet Earl is such a sympathetic character. Best of all, readers get a job to do: they can spot Earl, who is often lurking in wait, almost off the page, and predict his next Bobo-stealing move!"

Told from the point of view of a young girl, it chronicles her 100 year old great-grandmother's insistence that she go to vote in the 1994 elections. 
 This would be an excellent comparison book to a picture book about the African American voting rights movement of the 1960's. It is also a great glimpse at South African culture with a glossary in the front of the book that describes the African words. South African protest dances and food are mentioned and could provide excellent extension activities. 
 The pictures are created with pastels on sanded board. They capture the Soweto province in day to day life. The picture where Thembi sees herself in the newspaper is especially endearing."

 It is essentially a story about friendship, but could be used to show how people make mistakes and can work to fix them. 
 Dracula selfishly only send out the invites for his own Halloween party and throws away the invites for Frankenstein's party. Frankenstein prepares and is excited for the party, but no one shows up because they are all next door at Dracula's house. At first, it seems like Dracula doesn't care, but he finally has all of the party goers move to Frankenstein's party. For me, Dracula's gesture was just too little too late. I felt really sad for Frankenstein for most of the book. 
 The best part of the story are the illustrations. The beginning of the story has cool side slices of the two houses with a lot of dark, monstery details. And the pictures at the monster cafe and Halloween party are full of monsters and creatures from various lore."

 Not impressive. It seems to be a pointless melange of odd or out-of-the-ordinary laws and practices, treated as Saxon habit for 650 years or more. There is a Victorian's fascination with oddities, which I share myself, but not even the oddities were especially noteworthy. It does go to great lengths to ridicule King Arthur, saints, and teachers. I know a lot of you are upset by that."

Y con este mes, llegan las fiestas. No soy gran fan de las mismas, pero siempre lo encuentro como una excusa perfecta para regocijarme con especiales de Navidad en general porque me resultan sumamente divertidos, ya sea en libros como en peliculas, series, especiales, etc. Y este ano decidi hacer una especie de lista con lecturas navidenas, ?y que mejor que empezarlo con un CLASICO de clasicos? Porque no podria jamas en la vida pasar diciembre sin haber visto, como minimo, la pelicula del Grinch. A que seguro no soy la unica que la vio mil veces y no se cansa. 
 Pero jamas me di la oportunidad de leer el libro, lo cual me parecio una pena porque es tan cortito y tan mono que no podia dejarlo pasar. Es decir, las ilustraciones son lo que se destaca, sin duda alguna. Pero la historia en si es hermosa, principalmente para compartir con los mas chicos.

 We are still enjoying these stories. There is just enough intrigue to keep things interesting, but it's not too complicated, so it's perfect for my 5 year old.

 So, stuck with 3 and telling you i find it a bit better than ""just 3"". 
 You will, if like me, you occasionally pick up a YA book or if you have ""YAs"" in your life and read with them, find some of this book somewhat familiar. A group of 3 children (rather than a single child) are whisked away into the night away from their parents because ""an evil and powerful mage (magus) is after them!"" Why? 
 Because of a prophecy...of course. 
 Don't give up. This isn't really another Harry Potter wanna'be (well I suppose it does aspire to the sales and popularity)...but it does have some similarities with those books and a few others. Still, given time it manages to forge it's own story (mostly) and tells it pretty well. 
 I did find these 3 of the most annoying children I've run across in YA fiction (especially Emma the youngest) but bear up the book is readable and pulls itself together. 
 And ends in a cliff hanger that leads to another book...of course. 
 I suppose the book will annoy some people in that it deals with a book that has power over time and space. Paradoxes abound! How will we survive, how will reality hold together in the face of all these paradoxical events? 
 Magic...of course. 
 Alright anymore and I'll ""spill a spoiler"" so I'll stop with all that and say not a bad book. Readable (in my case listenable as I had the audio version) with some nice ""spots"". I think younger ""youths"" might find it more enjoyable than older. It's a bit simple in it's form and telling even with people leaping forward and backward in time and space. Judge for yourself. 
 The audio (by the way) is very ""listenable"" also, because it's read by Jim Dale..I think it possible that Mr. Dale himself deserves an entire star for his narration."

 It is so fantastical. A young girl gets a hamster and thinks she might want something a little more exciting. As she imagines have a gryphon, a kraken, a Sasquatch and many other exotic pants from the fantasy books she reads she starts to realize that the hamster is actually the perfect pet for her. 
 The art style is amazing and it has a lot of vibrant colors but also has a bit of a whimsical vintage feel to it.

 This story brings jack & Annie to a deserted island where some very nasty pirates are searching for the gold of captain Kidd. It also finally explained the mystery of the ""m person""! :) 
 Who built the tree house? How does it work? Why was it built? 
 All our questions are finally answered at the end of this fun adventure. 
 The writing is clear & straightforward, easy for kids to read, while giving them the confidence of starting real chapter books. :) they're perfect sized little books. 
 both jack and Annie are very different, but their differences work well together and their personalities are just distinct and rounded enough to keep them fun and interesting for the parents, but not to deep for the 5 year olds readers. :) 
 the illustrations are lovely too. They add so much detail to the story. I never noticed as a child, but they really are good. 
 & they're educational! Lots of fun, but you're still learning Little bits about so many different things. & it's not in your face about it, teaching with a cute, fun story. Here it's Pirates, but other books teach you a bit about mummies, dinosaurs, ninjas, Knights, the civil war, all sorts of cool stuff.

 This trilogy sucked me innnn. 
 I have never been so enraptured by drama before in a romance novel! I mean, every single layer of drama lifted had me anticipating what the hell was coming next! 
 Mia & Adam's craaaaaaaaaazy love story is definitely one for the books! 
 Although there were times I wanted to throttle both characters - there were also times I wanted to pull them in for a hug and cry with them. And Adam? That man cried, sobbed...he let it all out and I just melted whenever that happened. 
 All in all - great story with a chockful of drama, hurts, pain, love, deceit, lies, happiness...happily ever afters!"

Next thing I knew a couple of hours had passed and I'd gulped down the whole delightful confection. It isn't out till April so I hope this isn't a dreadful tease, but I thought Origami Yoda fans as well as others looking for good and funny middle grade books might like to know what they have in store. 
 So wacky this is (as another beloved Angleberger character might say) in the best way which is no easy feat. For funny is incredibly hard to pull off; what has me guffawing can just as easily leave another reader cold and vice versa. As someone who too often has been left cold by silliness I was wary when I started this one, but within pages I was completely won over. 
 So where to begin with this over-the-top story? The beginning, I guess. The first section is narrated by seventh grader Lenny Flem, Jr who tells what happens when classmate-and-supposedly-best-friend Casper Bengue gets his hands (or rather his upper lip) on a very pricey fake mustache, the Heidleberg Handlebar #7 to be exact. Somehow Casper knows of the remarkable properties of this mustache and while I don't want to give away too much I will say that they help him to begin taking over the world starting with state governor and moving on to president. And so Lenny along with a Hannah Montana-like television star called Jodie O'Rodeo (who narratives the second section of the book) alone have to save the day. 
 There are silly names (Casper and Lenny's town is called Hairsprinkle), pitch-perfect-for-kids grossness (boogers play a significant role), and some lighthearted pop culture baiting (e.g. Jodie's has-been status). There are wild and crazy chases and bad guys and much zaniness. One of my many favorite moments is when Casper in his new ""I""m taking over the world"" role changes Election Day to Monday so he can take over the US faster. 
 I will be eager to see what others think of this one, but for me it was a goofy froth of fun."

It's about four children going to a magical island of unicorns who need help. Every night the unicorns are attacked by a bat-like witch who scratches them, thus infecting them and making them lose their horns and their ability to fly. I found it particularly fascinating that the unicorns of The Legend of Wild Horse Beach are evil--they lure children to their island so that the kids would help them fight the witch. What these unicorns don't realize is that human children are no match for a flying witch. Such an awesome premise! 
 I found the book confusing in places, however, and I felt that the story would benefit from more extended portrayals of the four children. As it was, I was not even sure how old they were. Still, all in all, The Legend was a fun and fast-paced read."

 This was not one of my favorite Roald Dahl books. That is probably because almost every item and descriptive word was made up and not real. I really had to expand my mind to follow a long and to picture what he was talking about.

 The Magic Finger by Roald Dahl, Quentin Blake (Illustrator) 
 I really enjoyed this story! It was a fast, easy read that was very entertaining. 
 This story would be a perfect fantasy story about animal rights. The main character lives next door to a family that loves to hunt birds. She doesn't like that they are hurting animals, so she tries to talk them out of it, but they only laugh at her. Then one day the family goes too far and kills a ton of birds. This makes the main character angry and when she is angry her finger starts to tingle. She didn't mean to turn her magic finger on the family, but when the little girl is angry her Magic Finger takes over. It turned the family into birds! This forces them to live in a nest, eat nonhuman food and more. Then more problems keep arising... 
 I suggest this book to anyone that likes short stories and Roald Dahl's amazing writing :)"

 I've never read a Judy Blume book before, and now I'm kicking myself that I didn't read them as a 12-13 year old. Being 24 (and realizing with a sinking feeling that 12 years was half my life ago) I sometimes forget what it was like to be in middle school. The responsibilities and dramatics of being an adult are no less daunting than the responsibilities and dramatics of being a young teenager: the helplessness of watching your parents relationship falling apart, hating an annoying sibling accompanied by protecting them and loving them when it really matters, the loyalty of friendships that get you through the daily monotony of school. 
 There's nothing particularly deep or moving about Just as Long as We're Together, but the book helps tap into the memories that adults need to revisit, I think. We need to revisit them before we're too bogged down with paying mortgages and figuring out health insurance and becoming adults with children who are 12 and realizing that we have no memory of what life was like at that age."

She and her mother and baby brother Jean-Claude are living in a shelter while her mother applies for asylum. Anais' father is still in Africa, trying to keep one step ahead of the soldiers who are looking for him. Anais writes letters (in English) to her Oma back at home. Oma wants Anais to learn English quickly and has someone who can translate. She has encouraged Anais to find one good thing about America every day. Most of her letters are about her school experiences - holidays, her teachers, friends and food. 
 This is an enlightening look into the difficult lives of refugees. The difficulty of learning a new language while trying to adapt to the culture and even climate of the USA, all the while worrying about family back home, makes this transition difficult at best. An author's note at the end explains the spelling challenges (often Anais would spell phonetically) encountered by english language learners as well as websites where the reader can learn more about refugees and immigration.

When Eli and his family arrive in Pennsylvania, Eli dreads going to school. When school begins, he is perplexed by Master Christopher (real historical figure Christopher Dock), who rarely hits the students, but still frequently disciplines Eli for acting out in the schoolhouse. Over time, though, Eli begins to mature and after being left alone for a day to care for his home and younger sister, and then making a special outing with Master Christopher, he realizes the importance of working diligently in order to reap the rewards he desires. 
 This little slice of life story is a nice introduction to the way Mennonites lived in colonial America, and also a relatable story about a child who is anxious about school. For such a short book, it includes a lot of information about the Mennonite religion, language, and style of dress, as well as the founding of Pennsylvania and day-to-day life in the Pennsylvania Dutch community. It also teaches good character-building lessons about hard work, humility, and good behavior, and it introduces readers to a real historical figure in Christopher Dock, for whom today's Christopher Dock Mennonite High School is named. 
 Like Sticks Across the Chimney, this book also includes some racially insensitive moments. The most egregious is a scene where an Indian named White Eagle states in broken English that it's fine with him that white men took his land. I am not someone who tries to apply 21st century understanding to old books, but this was really over the top and borderline comical. The Indian character speaks like Tarzan, and what he says doesn't ring true at all. There are a few other appearances by Indians as well, but none of these characters really have anything to do with the plot, and it's unclear exactly why they are included. I wouldn't just write off the book completely because of this - kids can learn something from these glimpses into outmoded prejudices - but I also wouldn't want to use this book to teach a child about Native Americans. 
 All and all, I didn't think this was a great book, especially compared with others of de Angeli's titles, such as Bright April and The Door in the Wall, but it was a solid three-star story. It's not a book I need to own, but it has made me want to read some of de Angeli's other books, including Thee, Hannah!

Ava and Nikki immediately want to be friends with her, but Posey is happy with the friends she has. Besides, Grace doesn't even know how to play the hopping game properly! As Grace settles into her new class, Posey becomes more and more jealous of her newfound friendship with Posey's own friends until the girls find themselves in a big fight that can only be resolved with the help of their kind and patient teacher. 
 The Posey books are always delightful, and this one is no exception. Stephanie Greene covers everything that could ever worry a first grader, and she does it in the most comforting and warm way. In this book, I love the way she balances the excitement of an interesting new girl joining the class with Posey's worries over how this will change her own friendships. The reader can fully sympathize with Posey's concerns, but they might also find themselves fascinated with Grace, like Ava and Nikki are. Greene does a great job of leading the reader to the conclusion that there is always room for a new friend, and I appreciate that Posey figures this out mostly on her own, instead of from a preachy adult. I can imagine six-year-old girls looking to Posey as a guide on their own journey through first grade, and Posey fulfills that role admirably! 
 There are always moments in Posey stories that stand out for me, and this book had a few. First, I loved the moment where Posey is sitting next to Daniel in the car, and she points out that he is snoring. I thought Posey's reaction, to complain that ""he's breathing his germs all over,"" was a great insight into the way older siblings sometimes feel about their younger ones, and also a great way to indicate how Posey is feeling without her having to say it out loud. I also loved the misunderstanding that ensues from Grace mispronouncing ""cowlick"" as ""cow lips."" Finally, I enjoyed the way Posey works things out in her mind by acting out classroom scenarios with her stuffed animals at home. I think this is exactly what real kids do, and I love that it brings Posey to her own conclusion about how to be a friend to the new girl."
6cbfee0ca526f0b53e89b9d641c07d0e,12954580,26e5f38fd90316cc0082187513c1b169,3,"It's Halloween in this fourth book in the Princess Posey series, and the boys in Posey's class have told her that only babies go trick-or-treating with flashlights. Her teacher says they'll be having monster stew in class on Halloween. On top of that, one of the boys next door is wearing a scary ogre mask as part of his costume. Posey doesn't want to be a baby, but she is definitely scared of the dark and of monsters. It will take a lot of creativity - and some help from Gramps - to make sure Halloween is fun and not too scary. 
 I think it's hard to write a holiday-themed chapter book without repeating themes and storylines that have been done before, and I think that's why this book feels weak in comparison to others of the series. The first three books focus on problems that are specific to Posey as a unique, well-developed character. This time, Posey faces the same old fears that every chapter book protagonist deals with at Halloween, and as a result, the story is not as engaging as the others. I was puzzled, too, as to why the adults in this book seem fine with Posey trick-or-treating without a flashlight. I might be reading into that too much, but from the time the issue arose in the first chapter, I was waiting for the well-meaning adult to step in with the safety lecture and it didn't happen. Granted, Posey does not end up walking the streets in the dark. I just thought it was a strange idea that a child would go out at night without a light. 
 I think the best part of this book is the character of Posey's grandfather, Gramps. I like that he helps Posey with things like carving a pumpkin and putting together a princess hat. I also like that he doesn't indulge Posey's fears, but reinforces the idea that she should expect some gags on Halloween, but that she is capable of taking care of herself. The story as a whole also drives home the underlying message I think small kids need to hear at Halloween - that we fear what we don't know, but it's all pretend, and if we look closely, we can see the silliness beneath the scariness. 
 Just like the books before it, Princess Posey and the Monster Stew is a cute, sweet story just perfect for girls in kindergarten and first grade. It's just not the strongest one of the series, or the most memorable."

Fake Mustache is, as the subtitle tell us, the story of ""How Jodie O'Rodeo and Her Wonder Horse (and Some Nerdy Kid) Saved the U.S. Presidential Election from a Mad Genius Criminal Mastermind."" ""Some Nerdy Kid"" is Lenny Flem, Jr., the main character of the story, whose best friend, Casper, buys a fake mustache and uses it to brainwash the entire country into committing robberies, allowing him to buy a company, and permitting him to run for president. Only Lenny, who knows the mustache is fake because he watched Casper buy it, is immune to the brainwashing, but Casper knows he's onto him and will stop at nothing to keep him from foiling Casper's plans for world domination. With the help of TV star Jodie O'Rodeo, Lenny must find a way to escape the henchmen Casper has on his tail and unmask his friend as the fraud he really is. 
 Though Tom Angleberger seems to share a similar sense of humor with authors like Andrew Clements and Louis Sachar, this book is by far the most surreal and unusual any of the three has written. The Origami Yoda books dabble in the bizarre, but stick mostly to realism. This book deviates from reality almost immediately and just keeps revealing new layers of wackiness. And it is fantastic. Lenny is the ultimate underdog, forced to become a hero by virtue of the fact that everyone else around him has been brainwashed. Jodie O'Rodeo is instantly recognizable as a take-off on the plethora of Disney channel personalities, especially Hannah Montana, but she's more than just a pretty face, even if there is a tiny hint of romance between her and Lenny. Ultimately, what works the best is the fact that every aspect of this story is driven by the actions of kids. The villain and heroes are all kids, and adults become victims and pawns in Casper's plot, but they're no help at all when it comes to saving the day. Sometimes the absence of adults in children's books can be annoying, especially when it becomes an obvious gimmick to further the plot, but in this case, the lack of adult involvement serves to empower Lenny, who might otherwise never have the chance to become a hero. 
 This book is sure to be a hit with kids who have enjoyed the Origami Yoda books, and those who like their reading material to make them laugh. It's also kind of a fun tie-in for the upcoming Presidential election, even if doesn't have much to do with the actual election process. The short chapters will help even reluctant readers stick with the story, and I think girls and boys will both find plenty to enjoy as the adventure unfolds."

In each story, Katie faces a different situation in her classroom. ""Katie and the Class Pet"" is the predictable story of Katie bringing the class guinea pig home for the weekend and nearly losing him. ""No More Teasing"" offers effective solutions for classroom bullying. ""The Big Lie"" deals with the theft of a classmate's toy and lying to cover it up. ""Star of the Show"" focuses on the class play, in which Katie has a much more significant role than she realizes. Each story teaches a lesson that can easily apply to any child's day-to-day life at school. 
 Because they are now in a compilation, the four books included here are no longer divided into their own short chapters. It is almost as though each story is a chapter unto itself, a fact that is likely to attract new readers who are anxious to start reading ""big kid"" books. The illustrations remain, which is wonderful, because they're adorable and they offer just the right amount of clues to help readers decode what they read. In this new format, Katie Woo suddenly seems to fit into the same category as characters like Mr. Putter and Tabby, Frog and Toad, and Mercy Watson, all of whom star in longer, thicker easy readers. The transitional time when kids move from easy readers to chapter books is a tricky one for some people - especially parents - and this new format for Katie Woo fills a real need for easy-to-read books that more closely resemble chapter books. 
 I have always loved Katie Woo, and this book has made me excited about her all over again. Don't miss the suggestions at the back of the book for activities related to the stories, and also be on the lookout for Katie Woo and Friends, another compilation to be published along with Katie Woo Rules the School in August. Katie Woo and Friends will include the stories previously published as Boss of the World, The Tricky Tooth, Goodbye to Goldie, and Katie Goes Camping."

 Though I was always disturbed as a kid by the idea that a lion could come along and eat a disagreeable child, I still have fond memories of this book from first grade. The book - and Carole King's sung version, of course - made such an impression on me, that I actually ordered my own copy from the school book order way back when, and somewhere, I still have it. 
 The premise of the story is that a boy named Pierre doesn't care about anything. When his parents get ready to go out, he refuses to get ready and go with them, so they leave him behind and go to town on their own. while they're gone, a lion comes along, and when Pierre expresses his indifference to being eaten, the lion gobbles him up. It is only after a harrowing rescue by his parents and a doctor that Pierre finally learns to say, ""I care."" 
 As a kid, what spoke to me the most, I think, was the fact that Pierre finally learned his lesson. I always prided myself on being a ""good kid"" and bad behavior of any kind intrigued and troubled me. I liked it when other kids - even fictional ones - discovered the error of their ways and started to behave. I think it gave me a sense of moral superiority, but also made me feel safe. I liked knowing that other kids weren't going to get in trouble, and that nothing bad would befall them. 
 As an adult, though, I find myself looking at Pierre on a somewhat deeper level. I'm no longer focused on trying to reform Pierre's behavior. Instead, the storyline makes me think about apathy, and what that can do to someone's life. Pierre's indifference to everything isn't just obnoxious rudeness - it's also the reason he misses out on opportunities. His lack of interest in anything happening around him - from what he eats for breakfast, to whether or not a lion swallows him whole - causes him to become the victim of others' choices. When he learns to care in the end, it's not necessarily a lesson in being good, like I thought when I was six, but a lesson in being the master of one's own destiny. 
 The fact that two readings of this book by the same person taking place 23 years apart can be so different is exactly the reason I think Maurice Sendak is so brilliant. There is always something more to uncover beneath the surface of his writing, and always something adults can appreciate along with their children.

Each page once again features a border and the text stands apart from the illustration, situated above or below it, or in a box within the illustration itself. I absolutely love all the Fall colors Degen uses to portray the cool, crisp October weather, and his use of light and dark when it comes to carving and lighting a jack-o-lantern really made that segment of the book stand out. In fact, light becomes a significant element of each illustration as Jesse Bear goes out into the night to trick-or-treat and the street is lit up by a full moon. 
 In terms of the story itself, I love the way Carlstrom creates a safe space for kids to experience a fun taste of fear without becoming terrified. Jesse Bear is scared several times throughout this book - by his mother, by his own mask in a mirror, and by some fellow trick-or-treaters, but it's all in good fun, and everyone in the story smiles and enjoys themselves when it happens. By the end of the book, Jesse Bear, who was somewhat intimidated by his costume at the start, finally finds the courage to face his mask, and might even have the nerve to scare someone else. 
 The rhymes weren't as notable in this book for some reason, but I did enjoy the description of the family trying on costumes: 
 Let's work on the costume, 
 Lots of scraps and bits. 
 Dress-up clothes from long ago, 
 I hope that something fits. 
 Papa puts a black cape on 
 And some vampire teeth. 
 Mama wears a velvet coat 
 And tutu underneath. 
 I used to love gentle Halloween stories just like this when I was a kid, and I know this book would appeal to a lot of preschool kids going trick-or-treating for the first time who want to know what to expect. Definitely look for it next month to celebrate Halloween!"

 Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a book I have never read before and never owned. I decided to remedy that by selecting it to complete the 2015 Popsugar reading challenge for a book that is over 100 years old. I'm only reviewing the first book, despite having the collection, as that's all I've read so far. 
 I actually enjoyed Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. I thought it was fun and I loved the logical fallacies and the nonsense throughout, as I think that's the main theme. It's not nearly as weird as people have made it out to be. I was surprised by how little I liked Alice. I didn't find her to be all that curious or intelligent, but I hope that I see more of her personality in the next book. She just seemed bored and kind of rude. She literally argued with everyone, even though they weren't making much sense, some conversations did not require her input. Still, I think that's part of being a kid and speaking up when something doesn't make sense, which was the point of all the madness. 
 I couldn't help but compare the book to The Phantom Tollbooth because of the fact that nothing made much sense and the characters were all a little weird and set in their ways. I think doing that made the book slightly less enjoyable for me because there's no nice and tidy ending where everything is put right. In Wonderland, things just are the way they are. 
 Still, despite having seen a million adaptations of the book (I used to love that Adventures in Wonderland show when I was kid), I thoroughly enjoyed the book and thought it was less predictable and repetitive than I was expecting. I can see why it's a classic. I'm intrigued by the sequel and I'm excited to check out the other works of Lewis Carroll. 
 I don't know what took me so long to finally read the book and purchase the complete works, but I'm glad I finally did! I definitely recommend reading it. The first book is only around 100 pages, so it's quick and fun."

Since he's going into 2nd grade in September, I thought it was the perfect reward, and he finally read it to me recently. This book is great for beginner readers because it has a repetitive style and prose. All of the kids except one are excited about starting second grade. Andrew is apprehensive, but he finally comes around. It's a cute read.

Some articles (a, the) were skipped, and that made the text confusing for him. There weren't many words, so in that respect I thought it would be ""easy"", but it's probably better as a read aloud. 
 It's a fun story about a little boy who has to wake up the sleeping baby dragons and help them get ready in the morning. We especially liked the page with the waffle launcher to aid in feeding the dragons their breakfast.

This picture book tells the story of how she had to adjust to her new home in Canada. She describes the frustration of not understanding the teacher when she started school, not knowing how to ask to go to the bathroom, and being terrified of a Halloween skeleton. This is the perfect book to help kids empathize with immigrant children whose experiences are very similar to Saoussan's. 
 We have here a vitally important picture book, sharing the message of inclusivity and belonging, combined with art and color pallets that are undeniable in their beauty. Count me in! 
 Though it's a relatively quick read, From Far Away leaves an everlasting impression. One section in particular that had me gripped was about Saoussan's fear of the skeletons hanging up in school for Halloween. I couldn't stop spinning it over and over in my head. 
 Plus, the whole book is just very well curated, where everything, from the art to the accompanying text, flows together wonderfully. 
 And as always, here are some of my favorite illustrations:

 I loved this when I first read it as a kid (and on every subsequent reread of my favourite tale). Paddington's a great character, and he has the perfect antagonist in next-door neighbour Mr Curry. Paddington also applies a crystal-clear literal logic to every situation he encounters. 
 I loved it when I reread it as a big kid in my early forties, and it sits proudly on my shelf amongst the other novels I read when studying for my MA in Creative Writing. Sometimes great writing is deceptively simple. And this is great writing - start with great characters and see what they make of unfamiliar situations."

Potato chip king and multi-millionaire Dmitri Simon invites kids from local schools to compete in a puzzle competition to win some serious prize money for their school...and Winston Breen is one of the lucky few who gets to play! But it turns out Winston and his team will have more than just tricky puzzles to deal with, including a cheater who is out to sabotage the other teams! Will Winston and his team solve the final puzzle before the cheater schemes his way to winning the grand prize? 
 I though this was a fast-paced and fun book for the middle grade set. Laced with humor, messages about honesty and good sportsmanship, and (of course!) plenty of puzzles, The Potato Chip Puzzles was entertaining and would make a great summertime read for kids. Though I wasn't 'wowed' by the writing or the plot (the beginning of the book did not grab me, and I found it took too long to build excitement and pace), I did find myself trying to solve many of the puzzles right along with Winston and company! I would recommend this title for puzzle and mystery lovers in grades 4 and up."

It's the second in a series and I didn't read the first one, but the author did a good job of explaining the characters so I didn't feel too lost. There are some references to things that happened in the first book, but I could sort of figure them out. If you can get past the implausibility of the premise of this book (young Harry Houdini and two friends solve crimes and are basically drugged, kidnapped and taken to New Orleans), it's a pretty good story. There's a lot of action and you could really have some great conversations about discrimination and people's way of life. Unsurprisingly, there is also a lot of illusion and trickery going on (given that the main character is Harry Houdini). It was ok but it wasn't my favorite."

Rachel has to get on the pirates' good side and figure out how to escape her odd predicament. 
 The Pirate Bride is aimed at middle-school and early teen readers, yet I found it fairly enjoyable. Rachel is a character who is sympathetic but not at all perfect. You see her learn and grow as the story zips along. The book also has some good illustrations. Parents could buy this for their children, and still have a good read themselves."

A dress with skulls all along the hem and a motif of poison ivy and spiders' webs with blood-red petticoats. There is only one problem: her supply of gold is running a bit short. So she conceives of a wonderfully awful plan to turn the princes of the neighboring kingdoms into frogs and then offer the grieved parents her services in returning them to their royal selves--services that will cost enough to refill her money chest. Obstacles crop up from the oddest places however--trueheart Gracie Gillypot running away from her step father, Gracie's evil step-sister whose bright beauty contains dark secrets, a fast-talking bat who runs errands for the Ancient Crones, and even from one of the princes who Lady Lamorna is seeking to curse. But anyone who comes between the quick-tempered lady and her robe of skulls does so at their own risk. 
 I love the dark humour of this book and its fairy tale feel. There's the evil sorceress, the dim-witted lackey, the kind daughter abused by a step-father and step-sister after her parents' death, the prince who meets up with her. I like the prince character a lot. He's one of a pair of twins and unlike the sloppy twin characterizations I see so often in fiction the two princes have very different personalities. My favorite character though is of course the bat--a morally ambiguous smooth talker. I'm reading this to a third grade class right now and they're loving it. One girl even told me excitedly that she's reading the third book despite the fact that we haven't finished the first yet. I'm loving reading it aloud too. There are very few adult male characters, which are the hardest for me, and I love doing my evil sorceress voice because I love playing villains although with my looks I was never cast in a villainous role and doubt I ever will be. I love doing the bat too, with his fast-talking and the ogre lackey who thankfully has very few lines because I use a rough, gravelly voice that'd destroy my throat if I had to do too much of it. Overall we're all having fun with this book. 
 The book is mostly made up of two dimensional stock characters, but this doesn't bug me too much because it seems like a natural fit for the fairy tale feel of the novel. It's more like the original Grimm tales than the modern retellings (that I also love) that delve more into the characters. The pacing is also a bit fast for my tastes--I prefer my stories to linger in ruminations and descriptions a bit longer. However, it is precisely because of this quality that I chose it as a read-aloud so I can't be too annoyed at it. 
 I'd give this to third and fourth graders looking for a fast-paced fairy tale style story. This is also good to give to kids of that age looking for a scary story because while the cover will get their interest it's really more dark humor than horror so it's not too scary or violent. Anyone looking for a darker brand of humor like Lemony Snicket fans will also be pleased.

Other than providing a bit of background on Jenny and how she came to be an adventurer, it does not add anything to the plot or characters. 
 While the novels in the series are very well-written and create a sense of suspense, the short story feels kind of silly. I didn't find it funny and it certainly didn't have me on the edge of my seat. I actually didn't even expect to like the novels based on the short story, but I ended up really enjoying them.

 The writing is simple enough and easy for the beginning reader of chapter books that it makes for an easy stepping stone. I would encourage it for that reason alone to readers who may be interested in the type of book it is. 
 Otherwise it is a child's book that may not stand up to an adult rereading."

When a ketchup-on-a-toilet-seat prank angers their nerdy classmate, Melvin, he decides he's got to use his smarts to turn himself into a giant bionic boy so he can have the last laugh. But unfortunately for him, he sneezes at the wrong time and becomes the Bionic Booger Boy--a huge robotic snot monster. And furthermore, he's ANGRY! Looks like a job for Captain Underpants! 
 It's the usual gross-out with unusually sophisticated vocabulary and lots of bodily fluid jokes. And fake animated violence, of course. This is the first time a Captain Underpants book has ended on a cliffhanger! Tune in for the next volume!"

But when he does so, he realizes that Christmas isn't about presents at all! 
 I related to the Grinch a little as a kid because I was usually the only kid in my class who didn't celebrate Christmas. So everyone else kinda had their special time and I didn't know much about what it was about. I had my own holidays that they didn't have, but it wasn't really the same as being excluded by the majority culture. So that increased my sympathy for the Grinch, and I sort of rooted for him. I also liked that Christmas was about love and sharing and family in this book, and that the Grinch realized he had hurt people who didn't deserve it. Best of all, when the Grinch realized he had been wrong, he made things right, and received forgiveness and inclusion as a result. The illustrations of the Grinch, Cindy Lou Who, and Max are adorable and funny--how can you not love the Grinch's evil grin?"

 First off, the book is packed with the quintessential Seuss invented words, which make it fun for kids to read because they feel less like they're being force-fed vocabulary lessons. And the illustrations are lovely as usual--especially the depiction of Truffula trees, which look so squishy and bushy and fun to touch. The Once-ler--who is only shown through his arms--is a metaphor for faceless consumerism that depletes natural resources and will ruin the world unchecked, and the Lorax--who puts himself in harm's way to speak for the trees over and over again--is left to sadly leave the world when there's nothing left to save. 
 The story's deliberately exaggerated presentation of industry vs. nature does make it seem like there is no Earth-friendly way for industrial progress to be made--and that's not true--but it does accurately highlight the dangers of caring only about the needs of yourself and people like you in the short term, and it does show that even the perpetrators can suffer. 
 An excellent book, even if the ending is a bit depressing despite the hope."

Last night I took comfort in this collection of fairy tales compiled and editorialized for adults, probably young parents. Included in this collection was The Little Mermaid. Earlier this year I had read an online version of that fairy tale, likely a selection from the Guttenberg Project. The story seemed darker there without the art, without the sharp wirting of this edition I have just read. The sharp translations of Naomi Lewis and the exceptional art of Joel Stewart makes the difference. 
 A couple of Goodreads friends answered my questions about adding images. And then Goodreads updated. Above the review field there used to be ""Some html is okay,"" and now there is not. 
 Alas, I can only suggest that you look online at Joel Stewart's illustrations for Tales of Hans Christian Anderson. What makes his artwork particularly interesting? The perspective. In the introductory materials, Stewart makes clear that he has chosen to illustrate interesting moments and bits of the story, not re-telling the story in pictures. (the way illustrators of children's books do.) When the goblin in the Goblin the the Grocers looks into the room where the student vividly experiences the magic of poetry, the illustrator does not detail the vivid experiences, leaving that to the imagination. Instead, Stewart shows the effect of the vividness on the Goblin as he looks through the keyhole. We see the effect of the experience, not the direct experience. 
 Worthwhile reading, perhaps again when sick in bed and need something entertaining."

They have to dress as book characters and she must pick her favorite book and decide what character she will dress up as. I really loved this premise because this is exactly what they do in my daughter's school for Halloween since this holiday is not celebrated by everyone. She could really relate to the story in that aspect, and I hadn't encountered another book with this particular new type of celebration included. 
 Chloe must decide between a monster book she loves with her best friend Leo, or a fairy book she enjoys with her other best friend, Emma. The structure of the book is very similar to Crafty Chloe and while the ending was not as surprising and cool as the first book it will still please those little crafty readers. Bonus points for encouraging kids to make their own costumes and be original! And for letting girls know it's perfectly okay to love monsters and more boyish books. 
 The first Crafty Chloe book is one of my daughter's favorite books so we were looking forward to this new story. Fans of Crafty Chloe will not be disappointed with this new adventure. We are looking forward to more crafty stories from Chloe."

It's far too long for most children to sit through a telling so that's a downside. The Lorax is obviously protective of the trees and the environment and that's a great lesson to learn. However it's a bit extreme in places and contains more difficult language than many other Seuss books.

 The fourth book in the series Tales from Lovecraft Middle School, Substitute Creature, is in some ways the strongest book and in some ways the weakest. Either way, it's still exactly what fans of the series would expect. Robert, Glenn, and Karina are fighting for their school and yeah, you guessed it, their lives. 
 This time around an extremely unusual snow storm hits the town, especially so in the area of the school (surprise). While most do make it out of the school in time, Robert, Robert's mother, Lionel (a spoiled rich kid who refused to take the buses out as he was sure that daddy would send a driver for him), Miss Carcasse (the substitute librarian), Maniac Mac (the janitor), and of course Karina end up trapped in the school. 
 Robert is sure that something is up with Miss Carcasse but since he cannot possibly tell his mother and Mac about the school, he'll have to deal with most of it alone as Lionel is, well... Lionel and Karina has her usual ghosty limitations (which they're now trying to hide from the adults). Oh there's Pip and Squeak too, Robert has learned to communicate with them. 
 The villain here isn't given much build up that storyline is almost too easily cleaned up. Robert is faced with his toughest choice of the series and yet that aspect of the storyline sort of takes a nice cop out for at least a part of it -- it does open up the storyline for a next book, but still it felt like a cop out. Despite those weaknesses, this is very much in line with the rest of the series. In many ways the lessened physical dramas of chasing around the bad guys worked. Robert and his buddies finally have to face some of their own emotional and mental dilemmas, ones we haven't seem them really take on but should have before now, though this is still done in the usual lighthearted way you'd expect from this series."

But he doesn't decide to move to Australia, just to never play outside again. And who can blame him? No matter what he tries to do, the wind ruins it. He can't build a house of cards. He can't pretend he's a spider in a web. He can't do anything fun, so he is ""never playing in the wind ever, ever, EVER again!"" But when his mother encourages him to give it some thought and come up with something that he could play on a windy day, ""Huzzah!"" 
 Argyle is determined, spirited, and very imaginative in his games. He just needs to take the weather conditions into account. I'm sure many readers know how it feels to have the wind or some other outside force seem to wreck all the best plans. Letourneau's illustrations bring this frustrated little fox to whimsical life. Whether he is role playing in armor outside a cardboard castle, sporting a newspaper pirate hat and carrying a skull and crossbones flag, or looking dapper in his knee socks and soccer cleats, he gives all his favorite games a try. And when he sits down to think, I love the meditative pose with his legs crossed and his eyes closed. 
 This is a character who does not believe in half measures. His persistence and ability to overcome the obstacle that the wind poses to his outdoor fun will be an inspiration to readers of all ages. Highly recommended! 
 I read an e-book provided by the publisher through NetGalley (after seeing a copy at ALAMW17 and falling in love with the adorable little fox)."

Two children climb aboard a rocket and take a tour of the solar system in this fun bedtime story. Rhyming text narrates their trip as they rise above the trees with the houses below growing smaller and smaller. The moon smiles at them, the Milky Way beckons to them, and they imagine they are pirates sailing through the sky. During their trip they fly past each planet, noting things like Saturn's rings and Jupiter's eye as they zip by. They also pay attention to the constellations that they see like Draco and Leo. Stars that are bright and easy to see in the night sky such as Polaris, Castor, and Rigel make an appearance. And after all those faraway sights, they end up at home, safely tucked in bed. 
 The illustrations are done in soft colors suitable to bedtime, with lots of soft curving shapes and an absence of harsh edges. Readers will have fun comparing the sights from the space tour to those in the children's bedroom. Can they find some of the same objects in the mobile hanging over the beds, or within the patterns on the bedspreads? This is obviously a room decorated for kids who enjoy outer space. 
 This could become a new bedtime ritual for young astronomers and other adventurers.

It has a great protagonist in Samantha, ""Sam."" Each chapter ends with an excerpt from Sam's journal in which she records the highs and lows of her day, and hashes out any worries or doubts that she has. When these private thoughts are combined with the rest of the story, readers get a well-rounded view of Sam's character. One of the things that is unique about the story is the fact that Sam has Down Syndrome. While that is not the focus of the story, it does play a part in some of the scenes. That aspect of Sam's life is simply taken for granted by her friends and family and it is only mentioned when it relates to the story - such as when she is teased by some children. 
 The book is the first in a series, and kids who enjoy returning to the same characters for a new adventure (such as the Junie B. Jones books, or Magic Tree House) will be glad to know that Sam has more books for them to read. The plot of this story centers around some mysterious happenings in the neighborhood. Money and doughnuts have gone missing from a bake sale at the community center, more money disappears from donation containers at the farmers market, and a friend from the rehab center has gone missing. Sam and her younger brother decide to find some clues and it just so happens that brother John has lots of spy gear they can use. 
 I appreciate the way Sam is portrayed in the story. The focus is on a middle school girl going through all the things girls at that age are dealing with. She has a bit of a crush on a boy, she befriends a new student, she puts off doing her math homework until the last minute, and she loves being on the basketball team. Her parents have explained to her that Down Syndrome is caused by something in her chromosomes, so she may look or act a little different than other kids her age. But as they have helped her to understand, everyone has something different about them - their hair or eye color, or what sort of talents they have. ""If everyone was different in different ways, then being different was really a pretty normal thing to be, wasn't it?"" 
 The descriptions add humor to the story. When Sam describes the place where she and her brother go rock climbing, she thinks that it looks like ""a warehouse store, where Mom could buy mayonnaise in gallon-sized jars and toilet paper for an entire army."" And when her sister tries to make Mom's special macaroni and cheese recipe, it turns into a ""cheestastrophy."" The words in the story help conjure up images of John running out the front door of the school with his backpack unzipped and leaving a trail of papers behind him, or of big sister Jenny in the Goth look of dark clothes, dark eyeliner, and skull and crossbones earrings. 
 Fans of realistic fiction, stories set in school, or mysteries should give the series a try. Great for middle grade readers.

(Computerized Heroic Incredible Person), able to transform regular human beings into superheroes. Nort's father, Colonel Brock McKrakken, is in charge of security in the tiny town of Vortville, but has a habit of destroying half the city with each task. The colonel is obsessed with catching and imprisoning The Big Cheese - a supervillain so-named for stinking up the city with his Limburger Cheese. With Nort's father being so pre-occupied, Nort and his powered-up friend, Chip, are up against an evil more powerful than the world has ever seen. The Freaky Fuzzy Convention is in town, and many sinister plots are afoot. With Nort's nemesis, Gert von Brugen, determined to discover Nort's well-guarded secret, it will take every trick in the book for Nort and Chip to successfully stop a supervillain whose plans out-chaos those of The Big Cheese, and who is far more powerful than anybody could have ever imagined. 
 With not just one, but TWO supervillains on the loose, this superhero's tale is just what the city of Vortville needed. Richard Clark's story premise of good and evil is highly entertaining and extremely imaginative. I loved the idea of two genius children in a family where a boisterous ex-military father and a wallflower-mother almost seem to come from another gene-pool entirely. The sinister antics of supervillain, The Big Cheese, almost brought the house down with laughter. I found myself on the edge of my seat, however, and holding my breath when a second supervillain came into play, making the first one seem like an angel in comparison. The characters in My Best Friend is a Secret Agent were not only a breath of fresh air, but stem from an imagination beyond anything I have ever seen or read before. I look forward to reading more of Richard Clark's books in the future, and recommend it to readers aged 7-14 who enjoy suspense, fun and adventure, all neatly tied up in a wonderfully illustrated superhero package.

 But the more you think about, the less romantic it is. I mean, they're probably really dirty and well, if you fell you'd pretty much be smushed and don't even get me started on the pigeons. I can only just deal with the pigeons when I'm walking on solid ground but if I'm balancing on a weathervane and a pigeon flies at me? 
 I will freak the feck out. 
 I said it would take quite a bit to make me want to scramble around on Parisian rooftops, but actually, all it's taken is reading Rooftoppers. 
 I don't really have that much to say about this book because I just really enjoyed it and it's pretty much as simple as that. From the first line [ ""On the morning of its first birthday, a baby was found floating in a cello case in the middle of the English Channel"" ] I was tangled up in this gorgeous, unique and extremely heart-warming story about a girl with hair the colour of lightning who is searching for her mum after being rescued from a sinking ship by an eccentric man named Charles*. 
 I have to talk about the writing first because it was, without a doubt, my favourite part of the book. It was so delightfully odd without being weird for the sake of being weird. I could go on for a bit and tell you, using fancy words and gushing praise, how much I loved the writing but I'm pretty knackered and my tea's gone cold so I'm just going to give you examples. 
 ""Think of night-time with a speaking voice. Or think how moonlight might talk, or think of ink, if ink had vocal chords."" 
 ""It was the green that emeralds and dragons usually come in; which felt to Sophie like a good omen."" 
 ""They did not taste remotely like strawberries, but they did taste like adventure."" 
 See? 
 I think it takes a certain kind of writer who can make the ordinary seem extraordinary with a few sentences and capture your imagination and encourage you, if only for a little while, to see the world in a slightly different way than you'd normally do. And Ms Rundell's definitely that kind of writer. 
 I think the language and the style of the book perfectly complimented Sophie's rather strange upbringing and the fantastic and slightly naive way she interprets what's happening around her. She was a gorgeous narrator and definitely one of my favourite middle grade heroines. Fearless, inquisitive and completely adorable; she truly was brilliant. 
 And the setting? Let's just say I want to go to Paris again.... now please. I adore Paris and it will always have a special place in my heart so it was so refreshing to read a story set there that wasn't immediately bogged down by all the cliches that seem to latch themselves onto it. It was lovely to read about the city from a different perspective... one slightly higher than the others, shall we say? 
 When I was reading it and I was whisked away to Ms Rundell's dreamlike Paris where the streets are still cobbled and the streetlights are being lit by hand, I couldn't help but think of the film The Illusionist. Except Rooftoppers had a much happier and incredibly delightful ending. 
 So yeah, OK, I actually did have a lot to say about this book. But I really, really loved it and I really hope other people join Sophie for her adventure because it's truly magical. I absolutely can't wait to see where else Ms Rundell's stories takes me. 
 [Pssst... it's dead cheap on Kindle at the moment!]

Jane is the daughter of famous actors, although she plays that down, and she has been rather casually home-schooled up to now, when she enters the Chalet School while her parents are on tour in Australia. Like stereotypical actors Jane is over-the-top effusive, which the reserved Chalet School girls don't understand very well. But she is bright, talented, and unspoiled, so why does Jack Lambert (whom we met in A Leader in the Chalet School) hate her so much? It all started with a dormitory room switch, which separates Jack from her pal and role model, Len Maynard (Jo's oldest). But the mistresses are baffled by Jack's unrelenting dislike of Jane, even Jack admits to herself she is being unreasonable. A life-threatening adventure brings things to a head (another reviewer referred to ""murderous pine trees"") and of course things turn out according to formula: the New Girl is finally accepted and even admired. Jane is an appealing new character, and sulky Jack is convincing. But Jo (who writes two books a year and is the matriarch of the school despite having a large home and eleven children to manage) is as usual disagreeably perfect."

Being a Lowestoft boy (bred not born), I think this book already existed in the family library. 
 It stands alone from the rest of the cannon because it is truly neither a S&A book and nor a Coots one. It is Peter Duck's tale, invented by the Swallows and the Amazons during a winter holiday. It is obviously a fictious story, whilst the other invented tale, Missie Lee reads like it is a true story. 
 I don't remember much about my first reading of this book except that I was decidedly non-plussed by it. This time round though, I enjoyed it much more, particularly revelling in the descriptions of Lowestoft and the Suffolk coast I know so well. I did still find a jarring disconnect with it, in the speed at which they travelled. The adventurers seemed to reach Crab Island in the Carribean a bit too quickly and easily for a sailing vessel."

It is one of those books and those stories that is so ingrained in our culture that makes everyone think that they have read it. Indeed I have, at times, read some of the first book and I know much of the story, but even so there were surprises for me. Oh, this quote comes from there? That event comes from there...? 
 I finally decided that I *must* read this book after reading The Story of Alice last year, and with it being 150 years since the publication of Alice In Wonderland last year and Creation Theatre Company's marvellous (if deliciously weird) adaptation of it in the gardens of St Hugh's College, Oxford. I'm glad that I finally have. 
 There is a loose story running through the two books, but its a more of a series of events conncected with a mix of indefectible logic and nonsense, the like of which is bonkers but you just cannot argue with. To add to this, there are so many images and ideas in the book that I can take in quotation and reflection to layer beneath my own work-in-progress. Alice in this book is the heroine and is good, but what would happen if 'Alice turned bad'? What would happen if crossing the chessboard in Through The Looking Glass to become Queen took on a more sinister turn?"

The night children etch windows with frost; rip leaves from trees and toss them across the ground; knock over trash cans as they dig for treasure and steal slices of the moon. As morning comes, they dream the reader into day. 
 With shadowy illustrations and lyrical sentences, this book was a delight to read as it told the story of how things in the world around us change over night, so they look different in the morning. Parents and children alike might even have the opportunity to laugh and talk about things the night children did in their house while they were asleep."

It's a murder mystery, and several wonderful animals are being used in the story - a parrot, three silky cats, and a lovely black Labrador named Charley. Mandy is delighted with them. 
 But then, Charley goes missing. Has she merely gotten loose, or has she been stolen? 
 Discussion. 
 I've already mentioned in my slightly sardonic review of Cats in the Campground Mandy's highly romanticized view of animals. One really gets the feeling that she views animals as the center of the universe. They are helpless creatures who must be pandered to and adored by all humans. I have no doubt that were she asked that famous question - ""What is the chief end of man?"" - her reply would be ""To worship and protect pets."" 
 Not only are her own views highly unreasonable, she harshly judges all those who do not believe exactly as she does. If a person brushes by an animal without pouring affection upon it, they are careless and unlikeable. If anyone dares to dislike an animal - horror! What villainy in our midst! 
 The thing that really disturbs me is how Mandy allows her fiery temper to flare out at anyone whom she perceives as being unloving towards animals. This often causes her to speak disrespectfully to adults before she has even considered the possibility of a misunderstanding. (Perhaps the person isn't a monster - maybe he's just allergic to pet dandruff.) 
 Apparent from chewing out random adults, Mandy is pretty good relationally - she gets along great with her parents and is very sensitive with her friend, James. She also has thriving relationships with both of her father's parents. 
 Conclusion. So-so. Definitely filler fiction.

The story is so detailed and descriptive that you will feel as if you are in the same room with them. I felt every emotion as it happened. I cried, I laughed, I yelled a few times.

I really enjoy the film, but I was surprised at the book; it's like the folks at DreamWorks read the blurb on the book, took the character names and made up their own story. Please remember that. The book and the film are COMPLETELY different! 
 I'm not really sure what to say about the book though. I have a hard time discussing children's lit, because I don't really know much about the ins and outs of the genre. The writing was good, but there were a lot of adverbs and contemporary references. I guess this fits with the ""translated-ness"" of the book. The author says that she translated it from the Old Norse, and that it was written by Hiccup Haddik Horrendous III, so I can forgive that. Plus, since it's written for kids, I have to assume that contemporary references were for their sakes. That was the only thing that bothered me; kids are smart. I felt like references to flourescent lights and such dumbed the text down. But it's still a really solid, fun book to listen to. 
 That being said, I found out after I listened to the audiobook that David Tennant also did a recording. I've got Doctor Who on the brain, and it would have been awesome to hear him read something like this. The version I listened to was great, though."

The legend says he goes out to give alms to a poor peasant on the Feast of Stephen (the second day of Christmas, December 26). During the journey, his page is about to give up the struggle against the cold weather, but is enabled to continue by following the king's footprints, step for step, through the deep snow.

 Rusalka Reh's upcoming new children's novel Pizzicato, supposedly is written for ages 9-12. At least that is what it states on the back cover of the Advanced Reading Copy paperback I read. I felt that for low the amount of pages, the simplistic plot and low depth of character development, added with a very predictable path to the end, that maybe this should have been geared for younger kids 8-10. 
 It's a some-what delightful short story laced with a tiny bit of magic, but I didn't get wowed by it and felt it didn't really spark the imagination too much. I think a little bit more substance added to the story could have given it more sparkle. 
 The story is about a young orphan named Darius Dorian who is given an unusual school project. He is to shadow-job a professional for three weeks and is assigned to learn from Mr. Archinola who is a master violin maker. A few days after he is installed in the shop he notices a violin hanging on the wall that seems to have a mystical blue glow. Stealing this instrument to check out the mystery, Darius finds the violin to have magical healing powers. 
 Mey-Mey is a 12 year old girl who for some time has been visiting Mr. Archinola in secret to play the violin she loves, yet her parents forbid her to play. Mey-Mey has a deformed finger that prevents her from becoming a proficient musician in the eyes of professionals but continues to practice under the inspiring Mr. Archinola. 
 When Darien meets Mey-Mey the two become fast friends and Darien schemes to use the magic violin to heal Mey-Mey's finger, which will then offer her a promising career. But all doesn't go as planned and the story unravels a dastardly plot of kidnapping, fraud, romance and adventure. 
 With the plot rather low on complexity, I hesitate to say more or this will become a spoiler review. At times the story is sweet and endearing, but again, throughout the read, I was wishing for more. There just needed to be a bit more meat to it, and a not-so inevitable track from start to finish. On the whole, I can't say I enjoyed it much and don't think I could recommend it to others as being a must read. Sorry folks, my feeling is that it was a bit boring and lacked luster."

 It definitely has that mid-century British children's fantasy thing going on, with kids being left to stay in elderly houses with elderly relatives and finding their way into fantastical situations. But the writing is really unusual, very sensual and poetic in the descriptions, and not in an annoying way. 
 The other thing that struck me about this, in a post-Harry Potter world, was that the witches are bad! The little girl has a chance to go to a school of witchcraft, but it is evil and creepy and they do things like blighting turnips."

The result is that the verse maintains its simple sing-song quality, but gains a new vibrancy and interest. 
 OK, technical rant over. This is just the best book Seuss wrote - in terms of prosody, themes, and illustrations (the page turn between the smoggy present and the bright truffula trees of the past is amazing)."

 While reading book #28, I found myself falling in love with the Mandie books all over again. Mandie Shaw is still a wonderful Christian girl, with a fun sense of adventure and a good nose for mysteries. Snowball is still a beautiful, frisky cat to keep the story filled with twists. 
 This particular story takes place in the grand city of New York in 1901, and Mandie, coming from the backwoods, is quite enthralled with many things she sees and experiences. A Thanksgiving holiday is enjoyed, in the company of special people, and it becomes quite unforgettable as more characters join Mandie's ever-growing circle of friends."

 Molly's parents are very harried and busy, and one morning, Molly's father gets all the way to her younger sister Coco's school before realizing that she isn't in the car! Feeling very beige, Molly decides to dye her hair multiple colors and sneak an outfit out of her sister's closet. For the first time, people look at her in school, and the very cute Robert asks if she can help him dye his hair. Former friend Nina and new bestie, Christina, invite her to sit with them, seeing that she's gotten Robert's attention, saving her from having to hide in the library at lunch. This is the first year that her best friend, Kellan, hasn't been in school; his mother is home schooling him because she is overly protective of his muscular dystrophy. Molly sees Kellan a lot outside of school, and the two are planning on doing a fundraiser walk for MD, but her new friends make fun of him, and she is enjoying her new popularity too much to defend him strenuously. Robert isn't a great student, but he's nice enough, and he pays attention to Molly. As her parents' fighting gets worse, and her mother goes to stay with a sister, leaving Molly to supervise Coco and watch her older sister Eliza implode, that attention makes her feel better. When Christina plans a spectacular party at her country club on the same day of the MD walk, Molly tells Kellan she won't be able to go with him. Will Molly decide that her new friends are worth the sacrifice of her best friend? 
 Strengths: This was brilliant in that it plays to a deep psychological need middle schoolers have-- to be popular for who they are. Molly only changes her hair and clothes (with a little sass for Ms. Littman), and yet her old friend Nina comes back, she gets a cute boy writing his number on her hand, and she gets invited to THE most exclusive party of the year! She still gets to hang out with Kellan. The best part? When she ditches Kellan for the party, he actually understands why she did it and forgives her. Of course, it helps that she feels bad. The home environment is also unfortunately realistic; for as many middle grade novels as there are where Really Horrible Things Happen and the parents are prostrate with grief, there are really few books where the parents are just self absorbed and being serviceable but not good parents. The father comes out looking best in this one, and I liked how he listened to Tessa's very reasonable critique of her childhood experience. Kellan is also a stand out character, trying his best despite his overprotective mother, and growing when he doesn't have Tessa to help him out. 
 Weaknesses: Mrs. Littman's little talk with Tessa about her choice of friends, while circumspect, was unwise. I vividly remember Mr. Clingerman, my 8th grade science teacher, telling me that my best friend, Lori, was not a good influence on me. I was a good kid, and this just made me mad, and it made me dislike him a lot! 
 What I really think: Definitely purchasing, and this will always be checked out!"

 Anais and her mother and brother Jean-Claud have moved to the United States from Congo, leaving behind her father, Oma, and older brother Olivier. She is living in a room in a shelter, and trying her best to survive at school. She misses being in Africa, where it is warmer and sunnier than it is in Maine, but her teacher tells her to think of one good thing about America every day. Some days it is easier than others. Anais is worried about her father, who is being watched by the police, and doesn't understand why it is so hard for her mother to be granted asylum and for her father and brother to come to America. She makes some friends at school, enjoys her classes, and learns many of the crazy customs and practices of America. 
 Strengths: I very much appreciated that the author based this book on her work with students during her internship in ELL classes. She also says that she can't know exactly what it is like for her students who are new to this country, but that until they can write their own stories, she hopes this book will fill a need. I agree. We have a fair amount of ELL students in my building, and Anais voice was very similar to one of my students in particular. I, too, would like to buy books written by #ownvoices authors, but until more are available, I think that authors who have experience working with children in these situations are a good resource for my students to understand what it must be like. 
 Weaknesses: I'm never a fan of dialect and misspellings, although I understand the choice to use them. While there are some web sites to direct readers to information about what is going on in Africa, I would have liked a short explanation within the book. 
 What I really think: I think I will buy a copy of this, and I know that our ELL teacher will want to read it!"

 This sequel to My Secret Guide to Paris finds Phoebe and her sister Alice back home in London following their adventures in Paris with Nora and Justin. Alice is pining for Justin and also making college plans-- she thinks it is a great idea to head to the states so that she is on the same continent as her ""one true love""! Phoebe feels sad that her sister isn't paying as much attention to her, and they aren't as close as they used to be, so when she finds an antique compact with a letter folded inside of it, she holds out some hope that the ""magic spell"" it delineates is worth a try! She also hopes that the compact is worth enough money that it will help defray the cost of her sister's education, taking pressure off of her hard working parents. The letter is from a sister to her younger sister who was sent to live with another family during the Blitz. Phoebe sets off to follow all of the clues with her good friend, Ned, and has a lot of adventures, including tracking down the writer of the letter and visiting the woman, with her parents and sister in tow! 
 Strengths: Lots of good details about landmarks, and well as some very clever introduction to history. Nicely snuck in! Adorable cover, supportive parents, good friends, realistic problem with the sister. This was even better than the first book, since no one died. I enjoyed it thoroughly and think my students will as well. 
 Weaknesses: A tiny bit far fetched that Phoebe was able to track down the writer of the letter, and I couldn't help wondering why Alice didn't just go to a community college in the UK if her higher education was such a burden on the family."

The damage to the buildings is bad enough, but the real danger lies in the fact that the Bomb's Breath, a fifteen foot wall of deadly gas, is lowering dangerously and will affect the community very soon. Local scientists decide that this can be reversed if they introduce seforium into the atmosphere, but the closest place this can be found is 500 miles away across the Forbidden Flats, in the Rocky Mountains. With the help of guide, Luke, several townspeople, including Hope and her friends, take off to try to get the seforium in time, taking with them Ameiphus (the medicine they discovered in the last book) to trade. The journey is treacherous, but Hope finds out information about her birth mother from an unlikely source. 
 Strengths: This series is a great dystopian one for middle grade readers. I liked the details about what happened during WWIII to make the climate and topography so treacherous, and the structure of the various towns and settlements that the group encounters gives a good cross-section of how people in a post-apocalyptic world might reimagine civilization. The children being the brave ones who save the day never hurts, either! 
 Weaknesses: The story line about Hope's mother wasn't all that necessary, and slowed down the narrative for me and felt a bit interpolative."

Finding a hot dog vendor in the park, the friends come up with various schemes to distract Pete from his cart so that they can grab hot dogs and run. These plans include making Pete jealous by eating lots of hamburgers in front of him, flying a helicopter over the cart, and having Karen, a dachshund, pretend to be a giant hot dog. The group also runs into a band of wily racoons on the same mission. When Karen is accidentally put into a basket of laundry and taken inside, the friends change their mission to freeing her from the clutches of a man who does a bizarre mating dance and then runs inside his own house. Luckily, Karen is able to jump from a window and the group is able to focus on the matter at hand: obtaining hot dogs. The real cliff hanger: will they succeed? 
 Strengths: This was slightly more amusing than the first book; I laughed several times. The racoons were rather amusing. I wish that people who are buying books for second graders would buy this series instead of the Wimpy Kid books, since those really do cover more middle school issues. 
 Weaknesses: I read this on the same night I read the 5th Zombie Chasers book and a ghost written sports book. I am by no means a literature snob, but the convergence of the three of these made me weep for humanity just a tiny bit. Children will love these. There's something about adding poorly drawn pictures to anything that makes some children want to read a book. Seriously. Mr. Watson should look into illustrating Huckleberry Finn, The Scarlet Letter, or some of the other musty chestnuts that literature teachers seem to feel a need to cram in their entirety down poor high schoolers' throats. (N.B. To Ms. S-K: Picky Reader has NOT been complaining. The opinions expressed are purely my own. ) 
 There's got to be a middle ground, people. We need to find it between To Kill a Mockingbird and Stan and the Toilet Monster."

He and Glenn get sucked through a gate and end up on the roof of the school building just as a horrible snowstorm is revving up. The snowstorm, which is localized around the school, starts dumping tons of snow, so the building is evacuated. Robert and his mother try to take rich, spoiled Lionel home, but their car is hit by Miss Carcasse, the substitute librarian, and they have to go back to the school after being rescued by the custodian, Mac. Back at the school, they find evil creatures waiting to eat them (think Tribbles with fangs!) and realize that Miss Carcasse is one of Tillinghast's minions. Once again, Robert and Karina need to keep the school safe, especially after they meet Tillinghast himself. The evil genius is impressed with Robert, and offers him something he would really like-- if Robert sacrifices Lionel, Karina could stop being a ghost. This complicates matters, as does Robert's mother getting in on the secret of the school. 
 Strengths: Have to admit that this series is growing on me. I liked that Robert is growing as a character, and that challenges other than simply fighting monsters are being put in his way. There's still plenty of gross, scary stuff, but the intrigue is growing. The books are holding up better than I thought they would, as well. 
 Weaknesses: A zombie librarian and this little character development? Shame. Evil librarians should be well and truly EVIL. We They would never settle for being minions!"

Her mother becomes depressed and uncommunicative, and her wild sister Riley wants to run off to California to live with their father. Luckily, her grandmother has made provisions in her will for the family to be taken care of, and a family retainer, Butler Reginald, comes to help Tara follow the clues and keys that her grandmother has left her. She goes from her decrepit Southern mansion home to her grandmother's equally decrepit house, and from there to her grandmother's research facility on the island of Chuuk in Micronesia. Everywhere she goes, gorgeous butterflies follow her. With the help of one of her grandmother's assistants, Eloni, she uncovers a huge secret related to the butterflies, as well as an evil plot that she must foil in order to keep her grandmother's butterflies safe. 
 Strengths: Tara is a sympathetic character, and her grief for her grandmother is tempered by her worry and disgust at her mother's failure as a parent. There are lots of clues and puzzles that Tara needs to figure out that lead her to find out more about her grandmother's work with the butterflies. It's fun that she gets to travel around, with the bare minimum of adult supervision. There's also a lot of twists at the very end of the book that I don't want to give away. 
 Weaknesses: Like Circle of Secrets, this had enough quirky/Southern components that I didn't care for it personally. (Dialect and bad grammar-- ugh!) I'm also not a fan of clue oriented mysteries, and thought that it took too long to unravel and wasn't that compelling. My readers who like magical realism will like it, however, and the cover is very pretty. For the record: in case this is nominated for the Cybils' awards, this is definitely fantasy, since the butterflies have powers that are not realistic."

The power of the mustache is soon so great Casper has gathered a fortune large enough for him to buy the company that produced the mustache (as well as other fun novelty gimmicks) and to run for president, a step toward his evil masterminded goal of taking over the world. Lenny finds help in the form of Jodie O'Rodeo, a tween television musical star whose family lives in Hairsprinkle. In this rollicking adventure, the evil-doers are flaky and unapologetic, and the heroes are just trying to the right thing-- as long as someone will bring them some PopTarts as they try to save the world from the evil lurking behind the fake mustache. 
 Strengths: Like Angleberger's other work (The Strange Case of the Origami Yoda, The Return of Darth Paper, and Horton Halfpott), this is a nonstop GoofFest filled with quirky names, inexplicable obstacles, and giant sticky hands (there's a combo package for the next Scholastic Book Fair!). Totally orginal and unpredictable, fans of funny books as well as notebook novels (this has a fair amount of illustrations) will gladly pick this book up. I am always interested to see what Mr. Angleberger thinks up next! 
 Weaknesses: I didn't personally like this. Will I buy a copy or two and push them relentlessly on readers. Absolutely. Was it something I would reread on my own? Erm.... I'm not sure what it was-- either the use of odd names, which I always dislike, or the fact that I am not in fact a 12 year old boy (the I Am A Genius of Unspeakable Evil phenomenon), or an issue of falling on the elementary side of the Pilkey Line of goofiness-- but it didn't speak to me. 
 It will scream loudly at my reader, though, and that's what really matters!"

 Mr. Gilman continues his streak of creeptastic middle grade horror that would make any ""Goosebumps"" fan jump out of their seat. I've enjoyed the trajectory of the series so far, and I'm looking forward to what will come next. 
 A note: That cover is terrifying. I was fine with a demon teacher, snake-headed twins and Bug Boy, but Wide-Awake-Cadaver-Teacher is too much for me.

 I love Tom Angleberger. The man is a complete loon, and I'd be scared to know what goes on inside his head, but I love him. He has a way of capturing the adolescent voice, with all its oddity and normality, its wonders and squeakiness. One of his latest ventures into the land of pre-teen boys is Fake Mustache, or How Jodie O'Rodeo and Her Wonder Horse (and Some Nerdy Kid) Saved the U.S. Presidential Election From a Mad Genius Criminal Mastermind. Yes, that is the full title. Like with Horton Halfpott, Angleberger seems to love playing with us. 
 The ""nerdy kid"" in question is Lenny Junior, a twelve-year old seventh-grader with one real friend and one secret crush on a preteen rerun television queen. His best friend Casper surprises him one day with his desire to procure a suit and a fake mustache. But not just any suit and fake mustache: a man-about-town suit and the Heidelberg Handlebar Number Seven. Just what Casper intends to do with these items, Lenny has no idea. That is, until, the town of Hairsprinkle (what an awesome town name that is!) makes the morning news. It appears there's been a break-in at the First Bank of Hairsprinkle (seriously, how awesome is that name?). And the ringleader of the robbery gang? Just a ""short, well-dressed man-about-town sporting a spectacular handlebar mustache."" Now, no one but Lenny, and he soon realizes, TV's own Jodie O'Rodeo, realize that Fako Mustacho, a man rising steadily in power, is really a sneaky seventh grader bent on world domination. It's up to Lenny and Jodie to fight the brainwashed hordes and restore order before Fako succeeds in stealing the presidential election. 
 Early on in Fake Mustache, Angleberger references Daniel Pinkwater's The Hoboken Chicken Emergency. Rarely are literary in-jokes so apt. Angleberger does his best channeling Pinkwater's patented brand of zaniness. The premise, that a fake mustache makes young Casper able to brainwash the populace into thinking he's a legitimate businessman named Fako Mustacho, requires ultimate suspension of disbelief. Luckily, Angleberger knows how to write kids, and for kids, in a way that makes all the insanity real. After all, he had you believing in an origami Yoda puppet, didn't he? While Fake Mustache doesn't quite reach the heights of the adventures of Tommy, Dwight and their friends, it is certainly Angleberger's craziest output to date. And that's a wonderful thing."

It would seem as though 'The Lorax' had a meaning and message for the future generations, a warning even. My third grade teacher read us this story, and asked us what we thought, many were able to see the connections between our world and the world of the Lorax, where slowly piece by piece the world was destroyed by people with only money on the brain. 
 I was later read this book during High School, which would seem a strange time to be read such a book, but I realised something, there was a reason why we were having this read to us suddenly it became clear that it was us, us destroying everything. Not the businesses or people only interested in money, each of us were contriubting in some form or another. 
 Suess's writing is something that everyone should be able to experience, it does not matter the age, if its simple message can touch the hearts of more, perhaps there is something we can do to save this world. I recomend this to all, deep in meaning, well writen and of course the illustrations are as always perfect.

 Don't count your chickens before they hatch. 
 Sour grapes. 
 Honesty is the best policy. 
 Necessity is the mother of invention. 
 This is the first time I read more than one fable in a row. A few items of note: 
 1. The stories themselves are really short. Some are only a few lines long. I thought they were much longer. 
 2. Aesop loved to write about wolves, sheep, foxes, horses, and other animals. Whenever he spoke of cocks and asses*, I giggled like a child. 
 3. The Librivox narrator did a fantastic job. I can't imagine reading more than 300 fables--some of which are strikingly similar--hour after hour after hour. 
 4. It's pretty amazing how these lessons have stood the test of time. Over 2,500 years later, they still ring true and are used all.the.time. I can't imagine the quotes that will be used from our era in 2,500 years.

I seem to have started it so much that the first two chapters are falling out of the book! I can see why my seven year old self might have liked it. It's basically Little House on the Prairie before Little House on the Prairie but written after. It had a protagonist basically the same age I was, and it's a fun read. 
 But reading it after the Charlotte series was different. Young Charlotte and young Caroline are basically the same. Maybe we can attribute their sameness to an author shift, but still. Also, what happened to Mother Charlotte! I know she wouldn't be the same kind of mother as Martha, and her husband has died, but still! She talks like a Quaker at times and always quotes Bible verses. (Not that I have anything wrong with that, but she didn't seem as if she grew up like that) Also, it's never clearly stated that the book takes place in Wisconsin, at least not for a long time. 
 But on to the positives! This book does have great historical detail, and the characterization in this book is great! I love how Caroline is concerned with not getting her clothes dirty, and I love how she stands up for Martha. Henry-O is awesome, and I love how the children, especially Joseph, all look out for their mother. I think I'll enjoy this series once I get over the author change shock.

 Taking those fuzzy, warm feelings that can only come from nostalgia, I decided I would read it to my unborn child in the womb thinking I would feel the same way as I did back then. 
 The issue here is that I've come to really hate children's books that preach. It doesn't matter if it is a message that I disagree with or agree with, I would just prefer that we give children a chance to think for themselves. As much as I agree with the author's stance here and disagree with those who deny climate change, I think it's a more valuable lesson for a child to come to his or her own conclusions about the world. One-sided thinking is extremely frustrating no matter the position. 
 I might try other Dr. Seuss books in the future, but I'll pass on this one for the time being."

What drew me was it's design, it has interesting illustrations, like a children's book. I was looking for fantasy and something different, not involving romance, with magic and such, that's out of this world. 
 I found what I was looking for. Though it could be deemed a children's book, it's more of a young adult book with adventures. While reading it, I had to feel sympathy for Twig who was a total loser, always getting himself into some kind of trouble. So what if he's not really a woodtroll? I was intrigued on his adventure. It's funny how the saying ""what goes around comes around"" applies to this story. 
 He encountered a lot of weird and vile-looking creatures, expertly illustrated by Chris Ridell, and I have to admit Paul Stewart's storytelling was fast-paced and his imagery impressive. Before referring to the illustrations, he described perfectly well the creepy creatures' features (wow what a rhyme) and I was glad for the drawings because it helped me imagine the whole scenario. 
 Instead of Wonderland, it could be Weirdland or Whateverland. I was touched by Twig's friendship with the banderbear, his adventures really made him stronger; and with a mysterious guiding force, he always gets out of trouble. Then we'll find out in the end he's just a loser in the grand scheme of things (as directed by the Gloamglozer). 
 I was struck by the courage he dredged up from nowhere and by being himself, and not feeling sorry for his state, came a happy ending. There are a lot of morals here that I won't reiterate anymore. I'm definitely looking forward to reading the next in the series. So his adventures start now..."

 Most of them were entertaining, some were boring, but there are morals in the stories. Hans Christian Andersen uses symbols to represent good and evil, we can't always have what we want, but somewhere along the way we get something better that's essential for us. 
 My favorite Disney story is ""The Little Mermaid"", and after reading the real tale, I was, of course, sad about Ariel and her prince not ending up together; but when I realized that Ariel moved on to a better life than the one she has, I figured everything happens for a reason, and some things aren't just meant to be. 
 The author used characters that appeal to children, inanimate objects, the elements, but they are just masking the real subjects - man's quest for perfection, power, and how this makes him greedy. I'm looking forward to reading the full unabridged versions."

We loved the lenticular cover and the frontispiece graphic as well as the interior drawings. And the story was fun and quite enjoyable. 
 This is the fourth in the Tales From Lovecraft Middles School series and while we hadn't read the previous books as yet, we had no trouble picking up the continuing story and enjoying it. In this tale Robert and his friend Glenn with the help of a friendly ghost Karina are once again striving to keep the monstrous creatures from the other world from invading the normal world. Unfortunately for the world, and fortunately for the readers, they only succeed temporarily, so there will be more books and dangers to come. 
 Of course, most middle school students can tell you that many of the monsters have already made it to this world disguised as some of their teachers and as the seemingly obligatory class bullies that every school has. If you wish to introduce your ""littles"" to the love of Lovecraft, this is a good place to start. 
 By the way, we received this book for free through Goodreads first reads, and thank the author and publisher for the opportunity to read it.

I won't say I've been completely won over to his voice, but it did feel well-suited to this fantasy/time travel adventure, particularly the voices of the dwarves! 
 While the story itself didn't feel completely original, it did have a few elements that made it feel fresh. I enjoyed the combination of traditional children's fantasy (the evil Countess and her frightening creatures, the dwarves, the children setting off on a quest/adventure) and time travel, which I tend to think of as it's own category (traveling to an actual time in our history, as opposed to traveling to a time in a fantastical history). Some of the characters felt a bit flat at times, and I occasionally had trouble remembering which child had which adventure. Apart from that, an enjoyable story that I'll recommend to my legions of fantasy fans.

Twig is sent to live with relatives, and instead wanders his way through a bunch of encounters with strange creatures, some benevolent, some determined to kill and eat him (and not necessarily in that order). Eventually he finds Sky Pirates, confronts the Gloamgozer, and is ready to have more adventures in the next book. And upon rereading this for the first time since childhood, I have to say that it's not an inaccurate view of the book. On the other hand, it's still pretty fun. A big part of that is that all of Twig's adventures are fairly creative and aren't just the typical fantasy fare of beating up successively bigger goblins. Instead, there's stuff that draws influence from earlier books, like spending time hanging out with a bear, and when there are the obligatory goblins, the complicated ecosystem they're part of makes things more interesting. Plus, Chris Riddell's illustrations are fantastic, and do a lot to make the Edge feel unique - even more than it already is, by dint of being not a flat world, but the edge of a flat world. I enjoy that the reader never sees what's beyond the edge in the direction of the main landmass. Instead, there's a fair bit of worldbuilding devoted to various strange and creepy places. Plus, the sky pirate floatstones are definitely one of the neater justifications for airships. All in all, this was a lot of fun to revisit, and I'm looking forward to reading more of the series - including, perhaps, the books I never read when I was younger."

The story opens up with the narrator,Dazai himself, reading the story of the folktales to his children when the air raid is happening and they are in the confines of the bomb shelter. 
 There are four stories in this book of fairy tales; The Stolen Wen, Urashima-san, Click-Clack Mountain and The Sparrow Who Lost Her Tongue, in which Dazai attacks and analyzes the characters, the plot and the relevance of the story and the impact of it in children during his time. He compulsively reflects and projects his real-life concerns in the book and persistently provides commentaries on the events of the stories, ultimately retells the stories and add more depth to the characters and the plot. The theme that is uniform across Dazai's novels--the apathetic acceptance of loneliness (which is found heavily in No Longer Human) is also established in this book; it is a classic Dazai theme where the main character does not find sustenance with his surroundings thus resigned to live his/her life in loneliness and ""desirelessness"". An example would be the princess in Urashima-san, who owns leagues and leagues of land but is content on smiling at people and proceeds to staying in her chambers not thinking of anything and not talking to anybody; as well as the man in The Sparrow Who Lost Her Tongue who ""spends the rest of the day in his desk, wriggling on his cushion or nodding off or jerking awake until dinnertime and hits the sack thereafter"". An additional theme that is also present, is the appearance of utopia, places of reprieve where the characters find themselves free to do what they please (the story of Urashima-san when he finds the Dragon Palace), a place you can find warmth that you cannot have at home (the Sparrows Inn in The Sparrow Who Lost Her Tongue). None of this is permanent, of course, but the characters are transformed and have found peace in themselves when they leave the utopia. 
 This is my 4th story of Dazai and so far, it doesn't disappointment. His place in the Japanese literature is well deserved. Highly recommended!"

 At the beginning of the book, a supply teacher, attired in suspiciously appropriate clothing for 'Victorian Day', arrives at a modern-day school. He is shown to a classroom and, instead of teaching the children before him anything academic, begins to tell them a series of three spine-chilling tales. These stories, all of which have a historical setting, make up the bulk of the narrative, with interaction between the teacher and his students linking each of them together. 
 I couldn't tear myself away from these spooky short stories and found them genuinely frightening - especially Lydia (oh my god, Lydia!!) Priestley may be an author of children's fiction, but I would have been scared out of my wits if I'd read these when I was a kid! Each story had a genuinely macabre twist and all three of them shocked me. The two books I've read by this author have restored my faith in children's books having appeal for adult readers. I will absolutely read more!"

Ten-year-old Ruthie, along with her mum and dad (Tom and Kate who are wildlife scientists), and Ruthie's younger siblings, Liam and Bella, as well as their pet wombat, Womble, are headed off to the rainforests of Northern Queensland in their big green bus to investigate. The family has just spent 6 months helping to catch and tag shy rock wallabies. Cascade Creek promises a brand new adventure. Sadly, when they get there, the frogs have all but disappeared. Luckily the kids manage to find a frog (whom they call Wanda) but Wanda looks very sick. When they find a few tadpoles, the same situation prevails: the tadpoles are thin, not plump and healthy as they should be. They get Wanda and the tadpoles back to the Wildlife Research Station so Kate can take a better look. Wanda seems to have some kind of skin condition. Is this killing the frogs of Cascade Creek and how can it be cured? Luckily, naughty Womble's playful antics offer a surprising possible answer! 
 What a life Ruthie and her family enjoy, spending time away from the city and experiencing the wonders of nature. The kids do their lessons via school of the air and spend their days travelling with their parents around the beautiful Australian countryside. They learn about plants, animals, insects and a variety of indigenous creatures. They also learn about caring for the environment and the animals, and how important it is to preserve even the smallest of creatures, such as a little frog, because each creature has its part to play in the ecosystem. Author Emma Homes has a lovely way of inserting information about various animals, their habitats, food, and threats to their existence into the text. Ruthie is a wonderful role model for young readers and she is both compassionate and mature in her outlook. Hopefully this fascinating series will inspire young readers to look up more information about the animals that Ruthie and her family encounter. A delightful read that I highly recommend to all."

 Filled with cute illustrations, Davey the Detective, teaches children that finding a true friend is more important than finding treasure.

It's only through the help of Sarah, his version of ""Dr. Watson"", that Davey comes to realize that true treasure depends on one's ability to be a friend. 
 Written for the 5-7 age crowd, I was easily entertained by both Ms. Chand's voice and by the illustrations drawn by Sarah Shaw, which helped to bring the story to life. A fine addition to the ""Bird Brain"" series of children's books, I can easily recommend this as appropriate for any child in need of either a night time story or an afternoon read. Available in both print and ebook, I would highly recommend whatever medium you have available in order to both enjoy the book and see the illustrations in all their color."

Asking around, the only consensus that I can find is that they are pretty much comic books but produced on higher quality paper and bound like a book. That was not very helpful, so I decided to take the plunge and check it out. 
 When it comes to content, opinions vary. You either love them or do not understand the attraction. For me, I fall into the latter category. I just do not get the appeal. 
 The Boxcar children was originally published in 1924 and is a well know story centered around four children who create a home for themselves in an abandoned boxcar in the forest before they go to live with their grandfather they mistakenly thought to be a cruel man. I figured, why not start with an easy story to see if the whole ""graphic"" thing would help or hinder the storyline. 
 Personally, I think too much was left out. Relatively speaking, there were not many words and the reader was left to fill in the blanks with the illustrations. 
 Maybe that was the point and I am just too old to get it. 
 Truly, I do not mean to be insulting or dense, but I just did not get it. Obviously, others have had much better outcomes with this genre and I applaud their respect for the novels, but they are wasted on me."

But that's the wonder of good children's books - enticing you with a sense of possibility and exploration where danger is abound but not yet paralyzing. 
 I would like this book more if I didn't have to wait until 1/2 a book to get to the ""rooftoppers"" section. Eccentric guardian is always charming to read - and this one is no exception - but the whole thing about evil and traditionally-viewed social worker threatening the happy life has been rehashed over and over in other books. And that ending - it felt too abrupt. Maybe because there's no really happy feeling yet logical conclusion can be followed - though who said it needs to be logical."

 People who are familiar with the Obama family in office know that this dog was suppose to be ""Bo"" but in the book he is 'Dog'. The story is from Dog's perspective but descriptions are that of an adult. He tries to describe the white house and the traditions like the huge gingerbread house made into a white house or the sizes of the Nativity scene or how many Christmas trees there are etc. Then dogs from around the world start showing up and each one describes traditions from their countries. But instead of the writing being interesting and something a child could understand and be interested in was just written in a corny way with much left to be desired. As I said my young granddaughter lost interest fast... and I could only imagine an older child would be left, as I was, with questions as 'is that really true' or want to look it up for more information because it didn't give enough to explain to someone who had never heard of that tradition or way of life."

Although it is a chapter book my son and I sat and read it for about 30 minutes or so. Very interesting, keeping our attention. Just enough 'Science' to keep it educational but yet enough imagination in it to keep it fun too. Looking forward to reading some more. 
 This was wasn't disappointing after enjoying the first one as much as we did. Each book apparently will have a 'guide' to the two children in the book but to the reader-listener it will give History lesson or a Science lesson to the time frame of where the children are. A really neat series of books! 
 This fourth book in the series was very good. It's starting to wrap the series together although you CAN read them individually, it's just nicer to read them in order to understand what is really going on. In this book the kids understand where the treehouse came from and why it is there. And who actually it's been that has been helping them back to the tree house on their adventures to other places and times. I've been reading this to my special needs teen ager and he giggled quite a bit through this book at the main pirate's actions. I think he really enjoyed this one.

The illistrations are good and clear not super jumbled up; I'm just not a fan of comic book type layouts for story books. This story would be better for older children that can read themselves. And they probably would laugh at Scaredy's antics at trying to find that perfect friend when he comes across a friend that wasn't on his list he's unsure what to do but he figures it all out and finds that even though it was unexpected he ended up having a best friend.

 This book introduces you to Caroline (Laura Ingallas mother) when she was 5 (as in the other books they all seem to start when the child is 5 or 6) Right after Caroline's Daddy was lost at sea and so the story takes you into the first year of trials and adjustment of Charlotte doing what she knows to do as a single mother in the early 1800's. Caroline's Grandmother lives with them and she's spoken about from time to time through out the book but primarily speaks of Caroline and her older sister Martha. They do have several brothers and the oldest having to take on extra responsibilities now that he has to do more to fill in Daddy's place. 
 As in the other series of the Little House books; book 1 is always a little 'slow' as you are getting to know the characters and just get a feel for the environment etc. I really enjoyed reading this book."

 I can see that within the story, it was a nice and novel idea - a very fancified idea of purgatory and the comforts of an afterlife. Kingsley's writing, though, was not to my taste. There were large passages where he addressed the reader and went on for pages about pointless elements related to a fictional society from which he imagined the reader to be. These were very off-putting, and I wasn't a great fan of the ending either. I can see why it wasn't a children's classic I was read when I was younger."

 Although I've heard many a good review for this book, I struggled to find the magic within. I felt that it took too long for the book to set the scene and find its way to the Parisian adventure, and consequently the (clearly-well researched) tales of the not-quite-street kids was rather rushed and wishy-washy. Chapter 28 was a cracker - action, adventure, character, description, pacing - it was everything the story deserved and illustrated the strengths the novel could have reached. 
 From a Carneigie nominee I was certainly expecting a lot more (don't get me wrong, I loved the characters and the whole idea behind the story), but for me the bad pacing betrayed the true potential of the plot and writing, dwelling too long in England before rushing through the magic of Paris and ending rather abruptly, as if the keyboard had suddenly cut out."

 Jacqueline Wilson has always excelled at wonderfully imaginative storytelling, and Clover Moon is no different. She introduces children to hard-hitting issues in a non-patronising way and allows her characters to be complex and genuine, providing excellent role models for her young (predominantly female) readers. 
 Clover herself is a strong character, capable of fending for herself as well as caring for her younger siblings. She is fiercely independent and is not afraid of speaking her mind. When she is devastated by a death, her abusive step-mother forbids her to attend the funeral, so she decides to leave in search of a better life. Her journey gives us glimpses of life in Victorian London, from the very poorest areas to the very wealthy, and she makes unlikely friendships along the way. 
 Although this story could be labelled ""historical fiction"", its themes are universal and resonate with young people's lives today. Familial abuse, unfortunately, still happens, and poverty still exists. Escaping both of these situations is as significant today as it was 150 years ago. 
 My only criticism of Clover Moon is that the ending came rather suddenly and felt somewhat lacking. Certain issues (especially legal ones) had not been resolved, although I this leaves it open for a sequel and there was a nice link with one of the characters from Wilson's other books. 
 I will definitely look into getting this in to my library, as I know lots of students who will love it!"

I first got it for my son Leo but he was simply not interested in it. The reason I had chosen these books for him was because they have type in different colors and shapes, and I thought it would be fun to read together and then quiz each other to see if we knew the definitions of those colorful words. 
 Today I found this book (#34 in the series) in the ""little Free Library"" house that sits outside someone's home. 
 At home my youngest son read it with me, and we took turns reading the chapters. Even though it is RL3, he happily enjoyed it with me. It has been a happy afternoon. 
 The book is about Mr. Geronimo Stilton, a newspaper editor for the Rodents Gazette. It is a crazy adventure of an important document that blows away with the wind and travels throughout the city and into the most stinky places in New Mouse City. Mr. Stilton must recover it at all costs and comes close many times only to faint at the last minute. Luckily for him, he has great friends in high (and low) places that help him out."

Protected by the magic curtain, everyone in this hidden-away world leads a peaceful life - until a terrifying incident threatens to bring this to an end. Many an Een find themselves learning about the existence and theft of a special ""box of whispers"" by an unknown someone from outside of the magic curtain. Kendra are sent with a few other handpicked Eens to solve this mystery and they soon find themselves swooped up in a bigger adventure than they bargained for. Not only are mysteries solved on this quest, but fears are confronted, secrets revealed and valuable lessons learned. 
 Considered as children's fiction, this book has a good storyline and life lessons. Adults would probably become bored with it, or just simply annoyed with the excessive use of the alliterative alliteration. However, I remember reading this book lying in the grass in the garden in late summer and it can be fun to read on a silly day."

 It reminds me of a very old childhood anthology a traditional tales, one of which was called the Teeny Tiny Woman, and her guilty conscience nearly scared her to death.

His life, including the open acceptance by family and friends, is testimony to the value of fostering individuality and talent. it may sound hard to believe, but it is one of the most ""feel-good"" books I've read this year.

 I first started this blog back in 2008, if you search back that far you will actually find a post for Philip Caveney's 'Watchers' as an unpublished version. Five years on, I never thought that I'd actually get a chance to read the full book or even see it published. I've been watching, waiting and even flapping my wings waiting to read this. Fortunately, the wee independent Edinburgh based publisher Fledgling Press have done the honours of publishing it and rightly so. They've commissioned a fantastic front cover by Kylie Tesdale that might just make it on the list of this year's 'Book Cover Wars' perhaps . . . . what do you think? 
 After all of these years, was the book worth waiting for? Well, the answer is a resounding YES! 
 I loved every page of this book, in fact so much so that I would have liked to have read even more. It has a really good feel factor to it; a brilliant family read that everyone will enjoy from eight to eighty. It will lift your spirit and soul to enjoyable levels but, at times, it will also take you on a ride that may drag you down to hell. 
 This book is very cool - kids will relate to it on many levels. They will discover a ripping good story behind the book cover. It's very funny and witty - you will find yourself chuckling along to some of the antics from each character. However, it's also sad as well as Will Booth has to come to terms with the death of his father in a fatal car accident. Struggling to come to terms with his life, he has a chance encounter with a mysterious tramp called Ari. Will discovers that Ari is a member of a band of new age travellers - The Watchers - a group of fallen Angels that have been cast out of heaven in the ""great war"". The characters are very well written and somewhat quirky. 
 These angels have been sentenced to travel the earth, making up for their past sins, by helping mankind. However the second band of angels, led by the dark and sinister Lou, bring an evil and cruel element to the story. They devote themselves to causing mischief and have their sights on adding to troubled times for Will and his friends. I loved the idea of 'Hells Angels' being real angels and riding Harley Davidson motorbikes causing mayhem - this was really fun to read. 
 I would love for many people to read this book, so you may need to track a copy down. Philip has a great skill of blending his imagination which he uses to great effect in all his books. He really grounds the story in reality whilst also adding a large dollop of strong idealistic ideas which make the whole story sing. It reads like lightning; it is an adventure with wings that will keep you entertained throughout the journey. This is a fantastic and memorable piece of fiction which was well worth waiting for. It is one that I hope you will also enjoy. 
 Be a devil and pick up a copy. Read it and let me know your thoughts....."

 A girl with family issues in a town that has its own issues finds a new best friend and wages war on the baseball bat toting new principal. The ""hacks"" are pretty over the top, but the rest of the story is a very good standard school caper. 
 One way or another, it's entertaining,with some genuinely funny bits, even with a lot of stock characters and predictable plot twists. And there seems to be an opening for a sequel.

 By changing ""peddler"" to ""woodsman"", and making Santa look like a cast member of (ugh!) ""Duck Dynasty"", you have taken away one of the key points of Moore's poem, which is it gave one of the first images of ""Santa Claus"" as he developed from ""Sinterklaas."" 
 Moreover you picked and chose what you bowdlerized. You cut out the smoking and you changed the charming ""settled our brains"" to ""settled down,"" but left ""visions of sugar plums,"" ""kerchief"" and other such intact. So you changed things on the basis of what YOUR children get or don't get? Aren't you publishing this for lots of children out there? 
 As for ""spoiling the mood,"" perhaps if you're going to only read this one time, that might be so. But most families who read this poem are likely to want to read it more than once. Plenty of time to explain the bits they don't get and then re-read it. 
 Having to stop and explain things to your children is one of the most important parts of reading aloud! 
 Pity, because this is cute as a mouse version--though it's been done before:https://youtu.be/a46lTHxc1bo 
 There are lots of other lovely versions out there which DON'T feel the need to cut the text. I wish you'd done the same. 
 And I'd recommend that any family that intends to read this yearly purchase one of those other versions instead."

The curse of Toco-Rey involves these slimy creatures that if they get on you can basically make you go crazy and with the way that Peretti describes them just made my skin crawl. 
 This was a good book. It reminded me of the stories where someone tries to create a toxin of some kind to create an army or to whip out a number of people without having an army. It was the same thing here. The Cooper's were brought in to find a treasure and hopefully find why the last group that had been brought in was murdered in the process. Because of the storyline there was plenty of action to keep the pace going. Things came down to minutes or seconds of people needing to find each other and in that time you can feel your heart speed up getting caught up in the story cheering them on to find the other. 
 This story was beautifully written. It doesn't fail to suck you in just like any of Peretti's work. This is book six in the series and it is one of my favorites."

 Things were too good to be true when it came to Uncle Monty. Monty was smart, interested in the children and wanted to share his work with them. And it's a shame he wound up dead. Now before you start ranting and raving, one of the things I love most about these books is that from the off Snicket tells you things aren't going to be plain sailing with their newest guardian. Snicket warns us that Monty is doomed, but for a short while the Baudelaire children experience a small amount of joy since their parents death. 
 This book seemed almost more grown up, Olaf's threat of violence towards the children seems more sinister, with him brandishing a knife at them. Not only this but the circumstances of Montys death. Olaf made it looked like an accident, and the Baudelaire's have to prove it wasn't that. I almost want to say a sophisticated murder. It's the type of idea you would see in a crime show, as I said in my review of The Bad Beginning Snicket isn't shying away from the grim subject matter and doesn't talk down to the reader. I love that face he didn't write a 'simple' murder and by doing this he shows the reader just how smart the children are. 
 Once again Olaf escapes with the help of one of his associates and the Baudelaires fate is left in the hands of the less then helpful Mr Poe."

 JASPER'S STORY: SAVING MOON BEARS by Jill Robinson and Marc BEkoff and illus byb GIjsbert van Frankenhuyzen pub by Sleeping Bear Press 2013 picture book 978-1585367986 
 ""The small cages clattered and clanked and clanged as the truck made its way toward the Moon Bear Rescue Center"" near Chengdu, China. This truck is carrying the precious cargo of Moon Bears who have been rescued from ""horrid captive conditions"" where their bile has been harvested to be used in Asian medicine. 
 These beautiful bears are marked with the sweep of a moon crescent across their chests. They were stolen from their peaceful world, taken by ""farmers"" for their bile and are now on their way to a sanctuary where they will receive desperately needed care. For these bears human beings represent ""pain and cruelty."" The caregivers in the sanctuary can see the""years of anguish each bear had endured...in their physical wounds, swollen tummies, and missing paws."" 
 One bear is especially damaged in body and in spirit. He will be named Jasper and Jasper has been treated so cruelly that the staff wonders if he will ever recover physically or in his spirit. Hanky time. Jasper begins to heal and develop trust. 
 This beautiful, touching story tells of the work done by the caregivers to reach Jasper physically and spiritually. This is an important story about the dignity and sanctity of our animals and the wondrous connection that they offer us to a greater presence. It's our work to protect and cherish them and to promote understanding across cultural barriers of the damage done when we ""steal"" from our natural world. 
 Let's hope we can do better. There is a note from Jane Goodall praising the work of Jill and her team. 
 Somewhere moon bears roam free and in the sanctuary Jasper has come home. 
 Note; This book is about moon bears but it would be an amazing book to share with any child who has known abuse. That child will feel the bond with these bears and may be inspired and encouraged to move forward in his/her own life after learning what Jasper chooses. Great bibliotherapy."

However once I had actually begun the book the original feeling of exitement for this great plot idea soon disapeared becuase of the style of writing that I think was targeted for readers younger that the YA readers. In the end I had to put the book down becuase I wasn't drawn into the plot. 
 The descriptions at the beggining seemed charming, for example the description of the main characters hair as like lightning but the style of simple description soon became boring and repetetive. Another reaso I failed to finish this book was becuase of how I found the three main characters, Sophie, Matteo and Charles, to be irritating and completely unrelatable. Sophie was a young, exitable girl who longed for adventure but she seemed to me as more of a pestering girl who's disobediance to what Charles told her to do became repetetive and predicatable, although I guess without her rule breaking the book wouldn't have had much action. However I think the author wrote from the point of view of someone of Sophie's age relaistically although the style of writing from a child's point of view in a teenage book is not a good choice. I can't give an opinion on Matteo becuase he had recently been introduced bfore I put it down, however I liked the idea of Charles. Charles is Sophie's gaurdian and an intellectual who seemed interesting but what annoyed me about him was his ability to be continually entertained by Sophie even when she was being extremely irritating, surely such a smart man would find this girl irritating too. Also it annoyed me that Charles gave Sophie far more freedom than a child of her age is usually given and the duo seemed unrealistic. I liked the idea of the lifestyle the two lived, the writing on the wall and the ivy growing inside the house, I thought these were original and imaginative. 
 I couldn't get into the plot becuase I could not engage with the characters therefore I had no desire for Sophie to find her mother. If by the end of the book she actually did find her mother I would have thought it entirely unrealistic because given the posibility that mother had survived it was entirely unrealistic that Sophie and Charles would have been able to find her. 
 Overall I think this book would be much enjoyed by younger readers but it is really too simple for YA readers."

 The vocabulary and writing style is good for the younger but more advanced reader. If your child is a struggling reader, it's a good choice for a bedtime story due to it's shortness. A parent can use it to help teach the child new words and concepts like appreciating friends and not to accuse people of things without just cause. Maybe not the easiest of concepts to teach a child, but maybe it'll help them not to accuse their little siblings of taking a toy unless they actual see them do it! :D 
 The art is adorable and Shaw does an amazing job giving the animals realistic expressions, something I don't think is easy to do. It's simplistic but colorful and kids will love to see the images that accompany the cute story."

But Arthur Geisert does a very good job here. Most important for me is that the story progression is pretty clear even without words to assist, and that is definitely the case here.

 This poem book was quite unexpected for both of us. We didn't know what Lorax was! Who Lorax was! Like the kid in this book. 
 We paced slowly and then fast, upside down, inside out and when we knew about Lorax, we laughed a lot at his comic attitude and I-know-it-all personality.

 But will he succeed? 
 We didn't care, we changed the character of Grinch to Sam. Like we always do, enjoying anything and everything happening to Sam.

This is a simple story with extremely simple drawings. Stick Dog and his four dog friends, Karen, Mutt, Poo-Poo, and Stripes, are introduced to frankfurters and decide that they must get some because they are so hungry. Stick Dog, by far, is the most rational of the group, and he often has to reign in his friends' crazy ideas about how to get those frankfurters. Not to mention there are some raccoons - The Frankfurter Assault Squadron - who are also trying to get some of those delicious frankfurters. Will Stick Dog and his friends be successful? 
 I really enjoyed this story. This is a great book for reluctant or struggling readers because it's an easy read, but it includes a lot of inferencing and higher vocabulary that kids can understand through context clues or sometimes just direct explanation. It's funny - very funny. It also is a great transition to chapter books for struggling readers because it's a big book that doesn't seem like it's a big book when you start reading it but still has a decent amount of reading to it. This is a series that could help kids turn the corner about reading - I highly recommend."

I love some characters more then others like in every story but they are so well built it is always a pleasure to know more about their stories. I truly appreciated how the plot is so well built, it is even hard to spot any flaws and at the climax of the story every thing falls into its place so effortlessly it's amazing. My only to complains are that some characters from the first book that were brought to this book are dispensable in my own opinion and sometimes the description of a moment or an action seems to be so surreal I ask myself ""what are you doing??? that's not even possible in a land with magic and with teenagers!!!!"". In those moments I felt the author was running out of book space and just speeded up things for no reason. But apart from that a top read and truly entertaining."

But don't judge this book by its cover. Mary Stewart is great at suspense and unsettling moods, and she continues this in her only children's book, published in 1972. Her boarding school for young witches is nothing like J.K. Rowlings' wondrous Hogwarts school. It's more of a cross between mad scientist's laboratory and Dracula's castle. Not a place to linger. A chase scene on broomsticks across the moonlit countryside is outstanding. In this book, magic is both terrifying and fascinating, and creeps alongside our everyday lives."

 I cannot for the life of me remember reading The Lorax as a child. It took having an 18 month old daughter, taking her to see the new Lorax movie which opened on Dr. Seuss' birthday, and then buying the book because Sigourney loved the brightly colored Truffula Trees and cuddly Brown Bar-ba-loots, for me to read The Lorax. Honestly, if a better, more empowering critique of Big Business' role in environmental degradation exists, I haven't found it yet. 
 Typical Seussian rhymes and artwork are here of course. But there's so much more. As Once-ler's Thneed business begins to take off, and risk to the Truffula Trees increases, the Lorax's plea falls on the deaf ears of an out-of-control profit motive: ""'I repeat,' cried the Lorax, 'I speak for the trees!' 'I'm busy,' I told him. 'Shut up, if you please.'"" Wildlife reliant on the Truffula forest must leave to find suitable habitat. And the only thing that stop's the Once-ler's fast-expanding business? The chopping down of the final Truffula Tree marking the Lorax's dramatic departure. The truth that we all rely on our natural environment ultimately hits the bottom line, Thneed production stops due to the eradication of his resource base, and the Once-ler falls unwillingly into the role of environmental prophet. 
 It's the humbled Once-ler who utters this wise, inspirational, empowering line to a nameless young person (aka the reader): ""'UNLESS someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.'"" 
 The destroyer becomes the repentant voice of hope as the Once-ler entrusts us with the final Truffula Seed: ""'You're in charge of the last of the Truffula Seeds. And Truffula Trees are what everyone needs. Plant a new Truffula. Treat it with care. Give it clean water. And feed it fresh air. Grow a forest. Protect it from axes that hack. Then the Lorax and all of his friends may come back.'"" Ultimately, Seuss leaves the door open for us to succeed or fail. Yes there's hope, but we have plenty of work to do to realize this potential positive outcome. 
 The Lorax was first published in 1971 when I was a one year old. I'm 41 now, and except for a two-dimensional appearance on the big screen, the Lorax hasn't returned yet. Seuss' open-ended challenge remains urgently relevant today. Here's to hoping that The Lorax serves as An Inconvenient Truth for our newest generation."

It is funny and entertaining and Dr. Seuss always has the best illustrations. However this particular book has always stuck out to me as my favorite. It describes the story of the once selfish Onceler, who stumbled upon the Lorax and began chopping down all his trees. He made a clothing factory and used up all the resources around it to get rich, not caring one bit about the Lorax or the other animals nearby. Soon, the Lorax has to get up and leave, because he can no longer live there. The message of this book is one that is simple enough for children to understand, but important enough for them to want to change something in their lives. I remember, after reading this book and learning the message about taking care of the environment and not being selfish about the way we treat our planet and the people who live on it, I went on a craze to try to economize as much water as I could. I would use as thin a stream of water as I could when washing my hands, I would turn the faucet off when brushing my teeth, and I would even shut the main water switch in my house off if I thought that my dad was taking too long in the shower. This book helped shape me and the ideals that I have today, and I'm sure any child who reads it would still be influenced."

It follows the anonymous antagonist. He tells the story of how he cut down all the Truffula trees, and how the Lorax tried to persuade him to stop. This story is a cause and effect tale that warns children against making spontaneous and selfish decisions, and about the importance of environmental health. 
 Dr. Seuss is known for his language playfulness. He creates words, and introduces them in lively illustrations. The Lorax is no exception. He kept the antagonist as a mystery, so readers could place whoever they wanted into that role. However, I thought he looked a bit grinchy. 
 The lines in Dr. Seuss are long and sweeping, which adds to the surrealism of the stories. Along that line, the illustrations are outrageous, but familiar. He draws animals that look like their natural counterparts, however they may be an unexpected color."

 There is a reason these books are among the most challenged and banned every year: because they're that good.

I can't fight the urge to give you a sample passage: 
 ""When Melvin sat down, generous helpings of yellowish, pudding-like goo slowly dribbled down the chair, collecting into creamy, gelatinous puddles beneath him. The puddles themselves were slightly transparent and speckled with thick, shimmering nose hairs and dark red chunks of coagulated blood...."" 
 If you've read other Pilkey books, you'll find this one satisfying, but if you're a novice, I recommend starting with an earlier title, perhaps

 The older Anne has seemed to have lost a bit of spunk, granted she is 25, but some parts are a bit too sweet. 
 This book though chronologically features between Anne of the Island and Anne's House of Dreams was actually written more than 15 years after the rest so probably L.M. Montgomery lost a bit of magic too. 
 Composed mostly of Anne's letters to Gilbert, the omissions seem a little disconcerting, granted they do not add to the story (only the sentimentality) and probably would have been frowned upon in 1930s as suitable literature for young women 
 Gilbert's letters to Anne are entirely missing, also letters from home which added character to her stay at Redmond. 
 Above everything else, I miss the 11-16 year old Anne"

The farm where my wife works, and where Unabridged Toddler spends most of his time, has a tiny house, and so when this book was offered for review, there was no way I could pass it up. 
 Both my toddler and I were completely charmed by this sweet read and gorgeous illustrations. An old farmhouse is transformed into a tiny house, and he and his friend, Big Truck, travel the country and make friends. A snobbish mansion makes Tiny nervous that he's not a real home, but he quickly discovers he's home no matter what. 
 The text is rhyming, but not irritatingly so, and the illustrations are wonderfully bold and bright. As Tiny and his friends travel the United States, there are visible notes of multiculturalism that are welcome and appreciated. 
 Additionally, while this is a tale of a tiny house, there isn't any sort of sense of judgment or preachiness to the story, so those of us who aren't tiny house adopters (or even that good at managing clutter) need not feel guilty. (Jealous, perhaps, but not guilty!) 
 For my vehicle obsessed toddler, this was a related but wonderfully novel read that gave me a break from the endless loop of construction trucks and tractors that make up our book haul. (He's obsessed now with the idea that there's a place where tiny houses gather (the real life Tiny House Jamboree is featured in this book!).) 
 A lovely, unique picture book, this is a refreshing read that could have been painful hipster or irritatingly out-of-touch, but is instead warm, grounded, and fun."

 Author: Roald Dahl 
 Read by: Richard Ayoade, Bill Bailey, and Kate Winslet 
 Publisher: Penguin Audio 
 Length: Approximately 1 Hour (2 CDs) 
 Source: Review Copy from Penguin Thanks! 
 My ten year old son Kile, my eight year old son Daniel, and I started listening to this collection on the way to Mom and Son Scout camp. Their five -year old sister Penelope started listening at the end of The Twits when we returned home and now we can't go anywhere without listening to ""a story"" by Roald Dahl. Although Kile is at regular Scout Camp this week and we were told that we cannot listen to any more of Matilda without him. 
 The Twits are the most miserable people you have ever met. They spend their time putting glue on a tree to catch birds for their bird pie and maybe a spare boy or two. The monkeys they keep caged decide that they are tired of their and the birds' situations and are set for vengeance. The kids thought this was hilarious. 
 The Minpins was by far the favorite story for my kids. It was a great fantasy story about a boy, Billy, who ventures out into the woods against his mother's advice and discovers that the beast she had warned him of is all too real and has him cornered in a tree. While there, he also discovers an entire race of small people living in the trees who ride birds. Will Billy be able to find his way back home? 
 A girl has The Magic Finger and turns a family of hunters into the hunted so that they can learn what it is like to be a family of ducks. 
 This audio collection is superb with great jaunty music before and after each story and fantastically expressive narrators for all three stories. It is incredibly engaging for not only the children to listen to, but their mother as well. 
 Overall, this is a fantastic collection of stories that are full of Roald Dahl's inventive storytelling and dark humor. My kids and I loved it and are now continuing on into listening to Matilda.

I've read Stine's two adult novels, Goosebumps, Fear Street, and Point Horror, but if I'm being honest, I'd never heard of the Nightmare Room. It was a pretty fun read.

The illustrations are simple, but creative, the animals are easily recognizable, and the text can be sung to the first part of the tune of ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" and is repetitive enough to be easily memorized, so the kids quickly learn to follow along with the story by themselves. It's great for color recognition as well. And, of course, there's lots growling and neighing and meowing to be done! I think this is pretty much the perfect book for one and two year olds.

 If you like that sort of Mary Poppins-ish magical realism set in an idealised London and Paris (vaguely Edwardian, at a guess) then this is the book for you. Its ideal reader could be any age from 10 (the main character, Sophie, is 12) to adult. This story draws from many familiar children's lit tropes: the orphan looking for home/mother; the brave, resourceful girl who must save herself; a version of ""lost boys"" (in this case, the rooftoppers, arbroisiers and gariers). The book never seems cliched, though; even the familiar seems fresh and imaginative. 
 The book races towards its happy ending, but I did end up wondering what happened to Charles Maxim (Sophie's wonderfully endearing guardian) and Matteo (the boy who teaches Sophie how to explore the rooftops of Paris). I'd love a sequel -- or at the very least, for the book to extend a few more chapters. 
 Lovely, lovely book. I just reread the first 40 pages, which are entrancing from the first."

 Mom's Review: The story was so sweet and childlike it made me smile and tear up at the same time. I could just read this story over and over -- just so damn beautiful. I want to move in with this family -- oh no, wait a minute -way too many kids, I would never get any reading done. The illustrations were a little difficult to get used to at first, but after a few pages I started to enjoy them. I think they just bothered my eyes a little as they have a bit of a blurry feeling to them but it really does work with the story. The detail in the illustrations are hilarious and quirky and I really enjoyed them - they had a very realistic look to them in terms of the messiness of the house, etc. A pure delight go get yourself a copy and make sure your libraries have a copy too. This is a perfect bedtime story -- well it would be if your toddler liked bedtime stories (sniff sniff)

 Description: Jack has assembled a creepy cast of characters in his haunted house. As they chase each other around the dark halls, we meet a mummy, a ghost, a monster or two, and many more creatures that are sure to delight young readers. More fun than scary, this spooky twist on the classic rhyme is the perfect read-aloud -- even if you are a scaredy-cat! 
 This is the mummy, 
 That chased the ghoul, 
 That scared the ghost, 
 That sampled the stew 
 That cooled in the house that Jack built. 
 Jake's Review: Cool its by Helaine Becker, I like her books. It is a fun story with lots of really funny pictures. It is easy to read and I think it would be a better story for younger boys like my midget brother. The guy who did the pictures has a great imagination and the pictures are fun not scary. This book reminded me that Halloween is coming up and I haven't thought of a costume yet (Mom, I am NOT going as Dr Horrible -- none of the other kids will get it) I really liked the little rhyme at the end of the book, it made me laugh. I think it is too young for kids my age, but definitely good for young kids. 
 Jake's Rating: 8.5/10 
 Mom's Review: O.K. I will admit it I am prejudiced on this one, I adore Helaine Becker and I LOVE Halloween, so you know it's probably going to get a good rating just based on those facts. But it really is a lovely book. The illustrations are absolutely adorable, and nice and bright and colourful. My little one, who has no interest in books thank you very much, actually let me read this one to him (Sorry Helaine, he could have cared less about the words, it was all about the pictures in this one). I loved the rhyme and the injection of a few big new words for the little ones to learn. We had a fun conversation on the use of the word Forlorn in the book. Hubby and Jake thought the author should have used a different word, since it was an old fashioned term. I only objected to the word, because the illustration didn't jive with the illustration of the forlorn faerie -- I know - picky picky, but I am a Librarian after all! This would be a great book to read to the little ones in the 3- 5 age at Halloween, and a great story for the 5 1/2 - 8 yr old to read by themselves. A great addition to any

My favourite character was the eccentric Charles who adopted Sophie and serves food on books and encourages note-writing (between himself and Sophie) on the wallpapered walls. When the 'authorities' decide that is has become inappropriate for Charles to continue to care for Sophie at 12, the pair flee to Paris where they go into hiding but also attempt to find Sophie's mother. Sophie was separated from her mother as an infant when they were both on a sinking ship. While Sophie was found by Charles - floating in a cello case - her mother is presumed drowned. The story veers slightly when Sophie becomes acquainted with the rooftoppers - homeless kids who 'live' on the rooftops. Unbeknownst to Charles, she starts spending her nights adventuring with the rooftoppers and attempting to find her mother. Won't do spoilers here but it is a kid's book. A very satisfying read."

 This book contains a lot of outdated racial references. For example, the Native Americans are referred to as ""red skinned"" throughout the book. So I think that children need some explanation from the parent when reading this book. Parents also need to explain that some of the common anecdotes told about Pocahontas's life may be more myth than fact. 
 I still rate this book with four stars because the illustrations are beautiful and worth buying the book to study them alone. I also feel like there is some value in children being made aware of certain popular American history myths since they are so often referenced in films, books, and popular culture. (Example: George Washington cutting down a cherry tree.)"

I think any book that makes a kid want to read is a blessing, and I am thankful for each and every book that has found its way into my sons' hands. However, there are a select few that are really special and The Lorax is among those. I get choked up every time I read this. It's not just because of the great quotes - like, ""Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not."" It's because Dr. Seuss has the ability to silence the adult in us and remind us that we are all children; just in taller and more complicated bodies. He took a story about the dangers of capitalism and deforestation and made it into a rhyme that is so poetic, it is hard not to feel a genuine sadness for the fate of this world. The Lorax encourages its readers to become advocates for the Earth, and not just complacent, selfish consumers who prefer greed over love. I adore this book, and I am glad that it is a favorite of my children."

I enjoyed the story line with Hilde, but Sophie's storyline was like chewing cotton. You don't ever get anywhere.

I love the environmentalist message and this is a place where Seuss' rhyming anapestic meter is perfect for remembering the beautiful Truffulas trees, the ""brown barbaloots in their barbaloot suits,"" and all the rest of the damaged cast who are injured for the sake of Thneeds, ""which, everyone, everyone, everyone, needs"". I think this book really is good for revealing that the only thing that can help, with anything, not just the environment, is genuine interest and concern, especially from young people. I have been motivated by the Lorax and his ""Unless"" to be that person who ""cares a whole lot"" because without us ""nothing is going to get better, it's not"". The Lorax lets children know this so that they can, to use a cliche, ""be the change they want to see"" and go into life knowing that it is their job to make the world a better place."

 I plan to use this book right away in my class and with the club I sponsor, Earth Club! My EC teacher uses this book in her Study Skills classes to look at literary elements. I'm going to have her use it with our inclusion class to get ideas about how she incorporates picture books. This book really speaks to our generation and what is happening to the Earth. Dr. Seuss' voice is very magnetic and his pictures intriguing. His made up words appeal to children, who often make up their own words. I love how the ending is so filled with hope for the future.

Instead of hanging out at the pool and playing basketball with his friends in Florida, he's stuck helping his Grandma, who he has never even met before, at her Intergalactic Bed and Breakfast. At first he thinks the odd tourists at the B&B are nutty sci-fi fans, but then he learns the truth: they're actually real aliens who have come to Earth for a vacation! So much for a boring summer! 
 In Aliens on Vacation, Clete Barrett Smith's imagination brings to the page some fascinating creatures from outer space, and Scrub finds himself responsible for disguising them so they blend in with the earthlings. He also holds an even bigger responsibility ~ keeping the secret of the Intergalactic Bed and Breakfast from the rest of the townspeople, especially Sheriff Tate, who seems to know there's something strange about the people who are staying at the B&B. 
 This was a fun story with plenty of action and suspense. It's about a boy who learns to change his priorities and take on responsibility. In addition to hiding aliens, Scrub has to deal with regular kid stuff, like fitting in with the other kids in this new town and experiencing his first kiss. I read most of the book to my first grader, but he honestly lost interest. Some of the themes in the book ~ including the budding romance with Amy ~ were a bit old for him. I think it would be better for older kids ~ third grade and up. 
 I like the way Smith ends Aliens on Vacation. Many loose ends are tied up, but there is definitely room for an entire series to grow from this book. And I think the characters of Scrub, Grandma, Sheriff Tate and Amy are all interesting enough to make me want to see where the story leads."

This children's book written by Seuss in the 1970's is still as relevant today as it was when he wrote it...isn't that too bad. I probably got a first edition of the book, which I still have though much worse for wear, so I read a newer version I had. The greed of the Onceler having to get bigger and bigger and selling the Thneeds which everyone needs, leads to the chopping down of all the Truffula trees which deprives the Brown Barbaloots of their food and shade and they have to all go away. The smog from the factory chokes out the songs of the Swomee-Swans and pollutes the pond of the Humming-Fish, driving them all away. And then the Lorax is lifted away through the one small blue patch in the smog, leaving behind the Onceler and the word ""UNLESS"". 
 Such a simple story with the very memorable illustrations of Seuss, this story really makes you think. Is getting biggerer and business being business worth all the environmental damage. Look at fracking as one business that has the potential to make lots of money and also the potential to cause lots of environmental damage. That's only the latest...there have been so many more, and then there's ""drill baby drill"" in the Alaska wilderness and the tar sands. And that pipeline that was going to go through one of the biggest aquifers. Rush Limbaugh would support the Onceler over the bleeding heart Lorax...but in this case, I think at least the Onceler learned the lesson at a very high cost. Will we pay the same cost? I'd like to think water and food are more important than money and oil. Our children's health and our own are more important than consumerism. Yet I'm just as guilty of liking to be warm in the winter and not pay the high bills and liking to drive, not walk 3 miles to my destination. However, it is a book to make us think...and that's just what I'm doing. Thank you, Dr. Seuss."

To build confidence and make them feel great about themselves. 
 This book does just that - Little Jimmy helps children of all ages see how important it is to be yourself! The pages are full of color, the characters have great expressions and it's an all around fun read. This is a book I would love to see in my daughters school, at family friends houses and anywhere it can reach a child. Sometimes our children feel the need to not be themselves and it's great to see someone showing them that it's okay to be who they are. Every child should know it's okay to be different, without the worry that someone will judge. 
 This book is fantastic and well loved by this proud mom!"

 Roof Toppers is about a baby about a year old found by a gentleman called Charles Maxim. She was found safe inside a cello case floating on the water in the English Channel, after the sinking of the ship she was travelling on. There was no sign of her mother so Charles took her into his care and tried his very best to bring her up. He had quirky sayings and eccentric ways including writing messages to each other on the hallway wall. The lack of ladylike ways caused concern with the welfare agency and they aimed to take her into care. Matters that arise take Sophie and Charles to Paris in search of her mum. 
 The adventure that takes place in Paris is intriguing and mostly is carried out on the roof tops overlooking the city. Sophie meets some fantastic young people on her travels and learns how they survive on the roof tops/trees of Paris. Matteo lives on the roof tops and helps Sophie along with his other friends in the search of her mum. They face many challenges along the way and the bond between them all grows with understanding. 
 Sophie has grown up to be a caring and friendly young lady and this shows through her approach in coming face to face with Matteo and how she faces his situation. Although she loves Charles and he has done a great job in raising her she is obviously desperate to find her routes. Charles is eccentric but tries his hardest to do the best for Sophie even if it does mean facing imprisonment. 
 This book is great for adults and teenagers and I will certainly be reading it again and again. I struggled to put the book down to get on with other things and I even learnt things that about Paris. It is really a must read."

The ones whose pages become worn but that one can never really bear to part with. They're incredibly entertaining for children but also contain subtler, more mature messages. Those are the sorts of books I enjoyed as a child, that I've also come to love as an adult, as my understanding of them deepened. They offer more than familiarity and comfort, though. A good children's book speaks to some aspect of how we understand the world or ourselves in it. For me, The Velveteen Rabbit is one of those books. It's a story of a toy bunny who becomes real. It's his love of a little boy and that little boy's love of him that's so complete and magical that the toy is transformed into a real bunny. Love remains, even when the object of it changes or is removed; it is not experienced without pain and an acknowledgment of an otherness. It's a sweet wonderful story that I will never stop loving."

 The Lorax is a brilliant character, defending the defenseless trees and animals against the inevitable onslaught of industrialism. It is an early lesson in grassroots politics and standing up for what you believe in, even when your enemy is obdurately greedy. Though the ending for the Lorax is a sad one, the narrator's regret is a poignant lesson in appreciating and caring for natural resources before it is too late. 
 This book is as important now as it ever was and would make a perfect introduction to issues of environmentalism for young children."

Disgusted by not being able to do what he wants outside he informs his mom that ""I'm never playing in the wind ever, ever, EVER again!""

Her family is split up, people don't speak in French, and the food is very strange. But Anais's grandmother asked her to write letters in English and to include in each letter one good thing about America, and Anais is determined to keep her promise. 
 Starting on the first day of fourth grade, Anais writes often to Oma. At first, writing in English is hard, and finding good things to say about America is even harder. Sometimes worries about her Papa, her brother Olivier, and Oma overshadow the good things that are beginning to happen for Anais. But over time, Anais begins to make friends, build a community, and find many good things about America. 
 Told in compelling letters from Anais to her grandmother, One Good Thing About America is an important book for children to read today. Though Ruth Freeman is not herself an immigrant, her work as a teacher of English Language Learners in Maine has helped her to put her finger on the pulse of child immigrants in America today, and her compassion has allowed her to show the complexity of immigrating to a country in which the language, the customs, and the expectations are all completely unknown. The story includes not only Anais's experiences, but also some insight into immigrants from Iraq, Somalia, and Libya. In my opinion, Freeman soft pedals the frictions and misunderstandings that are likely to occur between children in school, perhaps equally in service to other elements of the story and in order to keep the focus on the many other challenges immigrants must face. For me, this decision works and makes One Good Thing About America a hopeful and heartwarming read. 
 I'd recommend this novel as a classroom or bedtime read-aloud or for students to read on their own. This debut novel will provoke great discussions between parents and children, teachers and students, and (dare I hope?) politicians and constituents.

 I read this somewhere between middle school and high school. It's a very engrossing girl teen read about three girls' friendship as well as their separate stories. The main character has been bffs with Rachel for the longest time but when a new girl enters their group, the main character starts to feel like she has more in common with this girl than Rachel. Rachel, to the main character, seems like she has changed a lot and grown distant from her friend, and the main character doesn't really know if their friendship can survive. The main character, who is allergic to bees and always carries an eppi-pen around her neck year round, deals with gaining weight, bullies, a crush on a classmate named Peter, school dances, her new friend, and her friend Rachel's aloofness. In the end the girls work out their hang-ups and realize that things do change because that's the way life works. It was enjoyable and a good representation of friendship and teen life."

A hamster that mostly just pees in it's cage isn't really interesting, right? So our heroine, a dark skinned brunette (thank you, Atkinson!) with a penchant for wily creatures starts hunting for a more interesting companion. She tries a unicorn (too shy), a hippogriff (they scare the dogs), a kracken (too wet) and many, many more. Each potential companion is accompanied by hilarious illustrations of the ensuing disaster. By the end she decides [spoiler alert] that her bed-wetting hamster might be the perfect furry friend after all. 
 VanSickle has created an engaging narrative that flows fairly fluidly throughout the book. It picks up speed as the story progresses, moving from one creature per 8 lines of text to 4, then 2. It helps the reader keep the intended pacing quite well. There are a few places where the rhyming trips just a bit, but not enough to deter the reader from continuing. The text itself isn't unique, which is unfortunate, but as a whole the narrative is solid and kids will adore the spunky story. 
 Atkinson's illustrations are what elevate the book from typical to above average. While the book won't be on any awards lists, you'll be hard pressed to find a cuter heroine and mythological creatures in a picture book. The color saturation is superb, page composition is tight, and facial expressions are spot-on. Children will love the snotty manticore, the unicorn bum sticking out from under the bed, and the pesky sprites. 
 Read aloud for a fun, mythological storytime or give to a child who is ready to learn some larger words on their own. I can see the book proving to be a gateway into the wide and very popular world of mythology for a number of young readers. It may not be an award winner, but it is fun, engaging, and well worth the read. Will look great on a display in your library or bookstore."

Clete was incredibly charming and his story sounded fun in a mad-cap way so although it was the first day and I already had a list twelve feet long of things not to miss, I made sure to make his signing and grab myself a copy. 
 Aliens on Vacation follows the adventures of Scrub, sent for a summer to stay with a grandma he's never met at her quaint little themed Intergalactic Bed and Breakfast. At the tender age of 12 Scrub is not terribly thrilled about his upcoming exile, and an alien themed B & B is definitely not going to help him get on the basketball team in the fall. But alas, if only everything at his Grandma's was as simple as helping Trekkie tourists! Turns out Grandmas little B & B is for actual vacationing aliens. Soon Scrub is knee deep in helping the place keep up with the summer rush while trying to keep the locals from being too curious about some of the strange folks rambling about town. 
 I adored that Scrub wasn't an angsty teen. There were no long drawn out chapters about how hard done by he was, and although it may be true to age for him to be endlessly difficult about his summer relocation, it was much more fun to read a story about a kid who just rolls with the punches. I also thought it was charming how quickly he becomes all protective of the aliens and his grandma, everything about this boy made me want to read more. 
 The actual story was funny and absurd in the kind of way I can easily picture kids loving, but the best part was how much I loved it. It held that same whimsical feeling Rick Riordan always captures so well so it's hardly surprising they snared the same publishers.

I wouldn't normally have picked this one up because it is predominantly aimed at younger readers but I'm so glad that I got the opportunity to read it because it was simply lovely. The perfect book to put a smile on your face at all the exciting and wonderful adventures that our hero Barnaby gets up to along the way. 
 I should mention that there are also some wonderful illustrations throughout the book by Oliver Jeffers which show Barnaby on his extraordinary journey. 
 The story is about embracing the things that make you different rather than always trying to change and fit in with everyone else. This is an important message to convey to children reading the book and one which we should all remember. 
 The book reminded me quite a lot of some of the best Roald Dahl stories where the adults are far from perfect and could actually learn a thing or two from their children. Mr and Mrs Brocket are desperate for their whole family to be seen as normal and one of their mistakes is to value this more highly than the things which make each of them special in their own right and which should be celebrated rather than hidden away. 
 A pocket sized book with a pocket sized hero, Barnaby Brocket is one of those characters that you'll remember long after reading the final page. He has a whole host of amazing experiences and sees some incredible sights as he travels around the world. He also meets lots of interesting people who teach him some valuable life lessons. He's an inspiring figure who we could all learn a thing or two from. 
 This is a great book for both children and adults. It is a unique story which is sad in places but ultimately an uplifting tale of daring to dream."

 Rooftoppers is the story of a young girl looking for answers. She was saved from a sinking ship, found in a cello, by a man with a huge heart, lovely and loving in every way, and that's how it starts. 
 I took my time with this book. I feel like I would have devoured this if I hadn't stopped myself, but this story was too beautiful and not prolonging the experience would have been a shame. This book contained a story full of wonder and imagination. It was both heart-warming and mysterious which is a combination I don't often find in books, specially in children's books. Reading this was an incredible privilege and delight, I loved it so very much. 
 The story, from the start, feels magical and, in a way, like a classic tale. This book also managed to bring the same cozy feel I have only experienced when reading a book by Rainbow Rowell, and that for me is a high praise. As for the writing style, it was very descriptive, but in a way that emphasized the beauty of everything. I don't often like lots of descriptions but this book managed to do it in a way that made me crave it. Furthermore, It emphasized and propelled the story further; it also help set the atmosphere of the story. 
 For me, characters are everything in a story. If I don't like the characters, chances are, I won't like the story either. Sophie, Charles and Matteo are beautifully crafted characters, complex, lovable and quirky, in every sense of the word. Sophie and Charles's relationship warmed my heart, they just loved and accepted each other, it was beautiful. As for Matteo, there could be another book written solely on him and I would love it to pieces. 
 Basically this is not really a review. I'm just praising this book in every way I can. I might have over-used the word beautiful, but is the only one that sounded right. I'm even considering not reading anything else until next year, because I consider this book to be a perfect closing to my reading year. 
 The moral of the story is: Never. EVER. underestimate a book targeted for children. NEVER!

Well, I am glad I contacted that author because the story was delightful. 
 First, let me start by saying that this book is written by a father/daughter team (the daughter being 11, if I remember correctly). There is also many illustrations throughout the book that were beautifully done. The story is about a girl, Rachel, who has several younger, and very annoying, brothers. But when her parents suggest a vacation with surfing lessons just for her, she jumps all over it. These lessons end in a surfing accident where she's suddenly in the middle of the ocean with land nowhere in sight. Until a pirate ship comes along and pulls her aboard. These pirates just don't seem to believe her story since they are actually from the 1700s. Surfing, what's that? Soon she ends up teaching these pirates a few lessons in cooking, cleaning, finding the northern star, and even reading a compass including which is north, south, east, and west without it. The moral of the story is that many of these events cause her to miss those brothers that drove her nuts, and crave the attention of her family that she wanted to get rid of only a few days prior. The pirates, with her help, find land and Rachel returns to her family, overjoyed to see them all again. Family is important and sometimes we take them fore granted. I guess the ""you don't know what you have until it's gone"" would work perfectly here. 
 The Pirate Bride is very well written with no plot holes--a cute and enjoyable story overall. The interactions along with the illustrations turn this book into a positively charming read that I would suggest to anyone who has children."

It was a sweet, magical story about Sophie who was lucky enough to be saved from a ship wreck by an eccentric bachelor named Charles. He taught Sophie that she should never ignore a possible. Sophie grows up with memories of her mother. Everyone tells her that she couldn't possibly remember anything from before she was one years old but Sophie knows to never ignore a possible and doesn't believe that she is imagining the memories. 
 When the English social workers come to take Sophie away from Charles when she turns 12, Charles and Sophie run away to Paris. Sophie was found floating in a cello case after the ship sunk. When she found out she had to leave Charles she throws a big fit and hits several items in her room. One of those was the cello case and she discovers a name plate which leads them to a music store in Paris. 
 Sophie keeps hitting dead ends on her search and in a moment of frustration she escapes through the skylight in her hotel room onto the rooftop. She discovers a whole new world up there, one that feels like home to her and brings back memories. 
 I won't say more than that because I don't want to ruin the adventure that awaits you as you read about Sophie's journey. I will say I love the characters of this wonderful book. From the rooftoppers to Charles, a wonderful, loving father to Sophie. He was a fun character that was eccentric but his eccentricities allowed Sophie to dream and be daring and brave to go on her adventures. 
 This is a fabulous book for any age but especially for older elementary age children.

 Fake Mustache, a children's comedy story, is American as is clear from the title. The novel takes place in a slightly bizarre version of modern day America, within the fictional state capital of Hairsprinkle. It is initially narrated by Lenny Flem Junior but later swaps to Jodie O'Rodeo. The action is spread through Lenny's house, the Heidelberg novelty company factory, Sven's Fair Price Store and the Hairsprinkle Municipal Stadium. 
 The plot is surprisingly complex, but basically Lenny Jr. saves the world from his best friend Casper and his fake mustache with the help of his favorite TV star, Jodie O'Rodeo and the mustaches inventor, Hank Heidelberg. Casper meanwhile has used the unknown powers of his mustache to raise vast amounts of money and get himself elected/chosen for increasingly important governmental roles. 
 My favorite part of this tale is a short section narrated by Lenny where he meets Jodie while in fancy dress as her. It is one of the funniest parts of the book. The character I like best is Hank Heidelberg, who is wonderfully old-fashioned and quirky. He knows all sorts of things which he does not at all understand the implications of and he stubbornly insists on remaining in a near-suicidal situation in a classic hero/martyr manner. 
 Something that annoys me about this book is that the American title has not been translated into British English and consequently says ""mustache"" rather than ""moustache"". However, this is just my problem. The only real issue is that, for a comedy book there is not that a huge amount of humor in it. This does not really detract, though, from and excellent and complicated story. 
 I thought this comedy might be a bit childish but it was actually great, even for me at age 14. I might get another book by this author if I saw it, but I have a feeling my friends would consider themselves too old for it. 
 I would give the story four out of five stars."

This short book is a beautiful collection of animation production sketches from Bambi. The movie itself is a symphony in many ways, and these drawings illustrate wonderfully the simplicity and elegance of the characters and the world they inhabit. There isn't much by way of realistic animal drawings that you read about them doing during production (the ones based on the live animals they kept on the studio property for reference), but the character drawings are really great. There is very little text, just some quick model sheet-type notes to indicate proportions or to ensure consistency, but the point of the book, as well as the real treat, is the art. There aren't thousands of drawings here, but the ones they chose are exquisite, whether rough or refined, quick gesture sketches or more finished works of art with shade and tone. The art of this movie is undeniable when you take ten minutes to just leaf through these pages. The design of the characters is genius, as is evident in their immediate charm and appeal. It really made me want to do some drawings from life, especially of animals. These artists were masters, I tell you. 
 I wish this ""Sketchbook Series"" would expand more to include publications about other Disney films, but so far this is the only one I've seen. I'll have to keep my eyes open for more. There's nothing not to like about this book."

 My first reaction to Krabat was that it was obviously not originally written in English. 
 I found it difficult to believe it is a children's book because it deals with pretty heavy stuff, namely black magic. 
 Our Krabat is a 14 year old boy who makes a living out of begging with two other kids. Then he moves to a creepy mill with a terrifying master and 11 other journeymen. 
 The story has the feel of a folk tale. I was enthralled by the sense of elusiveness conveyed by the writing. All the dreams and rituals played a major part in it as well. 
 I had a bit of a difficult time relating to Krabat, though. During his first times at the mill, he was aware that the journeymen were hiding something from him and when something odd happened he would notice and comment that it was weird. However, I never really felt him shocked. He would see all those things happen that made no sense and he would just embrace them and move on. Sort of like Oh, we're flying? And here I was thinking the clouds were mist. 
 I guess I felt that the transition from regular, christian life (because he did go to church when he was young) to black arts one occurred much too quickly. Even though I appreciated that there was no clear good versus evil struggle in the book, I remember reading exactly one reflection and that was him saying that those black arts could give a man lots of power and he would like that. That was it. Not a single time did I see him wondering if what he was doing was wrong or about the consequences of such actions. 
 As the story developed, I felt it got a bit too descriptive at times. I know nothing of mill workings so I felt my mind drifting away on and off. 
 There were some things I did not really get. For instance,if the master did not want them to read from the book, why did he teach them black magic in the first place? Just so they could work more easily? Or so he would have an excuse to kill a journeyman? 
 However, I feel that I cannot really use my usual references to measure my enjoyment because the story was just so different. For example, in another book the insta-love would have bothered me immensely. Here it still did a bit but it was so integrated in the magic that it was okay. 
 I felt the ending was rushed but overall I had a great time reading Krabat and recommend it.

I first read The Secret of the Old Clock in first grade, and now - as then - Keene's 1930's era tale of a lost will and the plucky attorney's daughter who tracks it down holds up remarkably well. I, on the other hand, have become the cranky old woman bitching about how Old Man Crowley's childish insistence on hiding his last will and testament in a clock amounts to a kind of near-criminal negligence. A solid, entertaining introduction to the immortal Miss Nancy Drew - before Bess, George, and Ned Nickerson make the scene - whose ability to endear herself to audiences of all ages seems eternal."

Even though Charlies, found her floating in the English channel after a shipwreck, no one can convince Sophie otherwise. When they threaten to take Sophie away because Charles wasn't seen a perfect guardian for a young girl, the two run away to France. 
 I really enjoyed this story. This is my second Katherine Rundell story and this was a much more whimsical story. I loved the exploration a young infant being able to remember her mother. I loved that no matter what anyone told her Sophie never stopped believing in herself. 
 I really loved Sophie and Charles's family dynamic. Charles was one of my favorite characters. He wasn't caught up with social rules or etiquette. He wanted Sophie to grow up in a loving and nurturing home. He indulged her in so many ways but he also installed a love of books and music. 
 I can see why so many people adore Rundell's work and why so many people consider this a new classic. It capture the perfect balance between magic, family, and adventure. 
 I give this book a B+"

So, we decided to give it a try, and while it doesn't quite have the adventurous spirit and tension that Nim's Island had to it, The Vanishing Frogs of Cascade Creek was still a wonderful read. 
 Miss L loved the red-headed Ruthie (red hair like me!), and the fact that Ruthie liked frogs (Just like me too!). So, needless to say, she was quite behind this whole ""figure out why the frogs are dying"" thing. (They gotta save them, mum!) She was also quite determined to read this on her own, and with the help of Kindle's dictionary, she was able to. 
 So, it definitely wins points for being able to be read fairly easily by a (albeit advanced reading) six year old. Miss L understood what was going on, she was able to converse with me on some of the topics (When animals go extinct, that means there's no more of them ever anywhere!) and she absolutely loved Womble the Wombat. 
 The plot was simple, the story straightforward. There was good information stated about saving animals, how vital research is, and that everyone can do their part. There was a bit of tension, a bit of laughter, and a lot of relief when they figured out how to make some of the frogs better. All in all, great book. Can't say anything bad about it!

 Written in the first-person voice of young Saoussan Askar, this story briefly describes the danger of war in her native country (Lebanon, though I don't see this actually stated in the book), and Saoussan's struggles with integrating into the school in Canada, her new home. 
 She is scared by a skeleton decoration for a school play, and experiences other practical difficulties due to the language barrier. But as she learns English, Saoussan blossoms and begins to make friends and enjoy the activities in school. 
 The illustrations in this book are very expressive and do a great job of communicating Saoussan's various emotions as she makes the transition from one country to another. This book is a wonderful way to help children hear about some of the many obstacles faced by those who make the brave decision to flee violence, even after the violence is behind them.

I was browsing around when I saw some artwork on another book that seemed very familiar for some reason. I went to the author's page because I suddenly had a vague flash of memory about a book I used to read when I was young, but I couldn't remember the name. But all it took was a picture to trigger it. 
 Sure enough, I scrolled down through Arnold Lobel's books and there ""Mouse Soup"" was.

 A huge blizzard traps Robert and his mother together with the concierge and a substitute teacher in Lovecraft Middle School. Soon Robert and Karina, the ghost of a girl that can't leave the school, discover that the blizzard is a cover unnatural creatures to enter the world. 
 I loved the monsters in Substitute Creature. They're scary and adorable at the same time, and the illustrations made my day. After all the gross insect-like monsters we've encountered so far, it was great to have a bit more cuddly monsters. I liked the setting of the snowed in school, being unable to have contact with the outside world makes it all seem more real somehow. 
 There is some slight romantic development between Robert and Karina which is absolutely adorable. Middle grade book romance is the best. YA books should take a page from this on how to have a sweet but non-scary crush on someone. 
 I also feel like the stakes are getting higher in every book. Although Substitute CreatureM doesn't end on a cliffhanger, there are a lot of unresolved questions that I'm sure will be addressed in the next book. I'm looking forward to the next book, I feel that Mr Gilman is improving his writing in every new release."

The story is really bare bones, I would consider it too simplistic for a picture book, it reads like a blurb out of a childish mythology book and yet that is not a good thing. Hades kidnaps Persephone and she is weeping and generally being sad-face, then Hades is all like ""you've made me happy, I love you, but if you have to go, I will let you go"" and he seems ally guilty and sweet, then of course he tricks her into eating some pomegranate seeds. I just feel that a child would be confused, and a few lines about him loving her so much that he needed her to be with him for some of the times, or her beginning to care for him/pity him and eating them on purpose, anything to make it less of a ""boogeyman is going to steal you off to hell and keep you there against your will"" story. Most of the mythology/folklore picture books I've read had a little something somewhere that was extra, unique to that volume, made it have a reason for existing, and I don't think this one did. 
 The illustrations are very pretty, evoking Greek sculpture and pottery, particularly in the figures, but it was not enough to keep me liking this book."

 This time promises to be no different. One-Eyed Jack has a pirate who isn't paying his full dues, so Dean goes in to figure out why (and to make sure he delivers). But things go from bad to worse when Dean ends up on the legendary island of Zenhala, about to pull off the scam of his life. If he can survive long enough to collect his freedom from One-Eyed Jack. 
 I don't usually go for pirate stories, but I was curious about this one since I enjoyed Matt Myklusch's last trilogy so much. This one hits many of the same notes: an endearing main character, wild adventures, and inventive solutions for terrible problems. I also liked Dean's unfolding realizations not only about the island but himself, culminating in his ultimate speech to One-Eyed Jack. 
 Dean's situation on the island is compounded by his allies (if you can call them that). One rogue who would happily stab him in the back, one probably-trustworthy except for the fact he hates Dean. And, of course, Waverly---the first girl Dean's ever really had a chance to see up close, and fated to be his wife (as long as he's really the lost prince). Dean finds himself warming to the idea quickly, but she has other plans. 
 All in all this was a good read. I liked the kiteboards best; this is a very visual novel with some great action scenes. I rate this book Recommended.

I wish adults would read this one too and remember the message - how candid God's love is toward us. On our personal journey, we are often labeled and framed according to our performance which is measured by human standards. God does not see us in labels, frames, or colors, and does not love us according to our performance. He made us, He did not make a mistake, and loves us as we are because we belong to Him. Once these words become revelation in us, everything changes and what others think about us matters very little because what is important is that in the greater scheme of things, we are beautiful in our Creator's eyes."

I enjoyed this title with the die cut pages depicting mountains and especially liked her images of a turkey, a turtle, fish, and butterflies made from leaves. Nice leaf identification on the end paper showing which ones Ehlert used for her collages in the book. Job well done."

The illustration technique is unique: pouring colored cotton pulp through hand-cut stencils makes for beautiful textured illustrations. Also the colors depict fall well. I would love to use this in a storytime."

Catkin leaps over the stonewall to go on a hunt during which he encounters various woodland creatures. Wonderful illustrations fill the entire page with an almost medieval look and feel. Only the ""text boxes"" are white. Each page has a border and as each new creature is encountered, it becomes part of the cumulative border. Even the end papers are illustrated with lovely Catkin. A satisfying story for the preschooler and a visual delight for all of us. If I were on the Caldecott committee this one would be getting my vote."

 Much of the plot is similar to the Disney film. Captain Hook is definitely more bloodthirsty (people actually die), Tinker bell is more cross and the children stay away longer. It's amazing that Disney has expanded it so much past its original parameters (with Jake and the Fairy franchises). 
 The Darling children fly away with Peter Pan to Neverland where they have many adventures."

 I just love that Nancy Drew! Her stories are so pure and free of the garbage that litters so many good books today. I also use these to study grammar and punctuation. Her books are free of slang and cliches so common in current fiction. This story was fun too. Nancy met lots of interesting characters and set out on her own to solve the mystery. Once she was almost caught spying on thieves. Later she actually was caught. Modern novels might have used these scenes for a chance to throw in some graphic imagery or violence but Carolyn Keene (ghostwriter) used it to show Nancy's pluckiness. In her day, she was extraordinary!

 The story is that of the cycle of life. It is about a seedling slowly growing into a tree over the years. 
 It's a pop-up book with each page showing a different stage of the tree (and its view on the world through the perspective of the shadows) until ... the tree is gone. This emphasizes the expectation of the reader to turn the page and find the tree yet again, ultimately realizing the importance of the tree through its absence. However, it's not a story of loss but rather of death being part of life and with hope at the end. 
 To think that this great artist has only started creating his wonderful books when his first child was born (he apparently wanted to teach his kid certain life lessons in this way). I'm glad he's sharing these important lessons in such a stunning visual form with the world, though I have to sadly admit that I wasn't able to get a copy of this book so I read it through online images / a video."

 Now, for any who have seen the film and not read the book yet, I should say that the book is slightly different, because the story is slightly shorter, which would not have worked for a movie. 
 Nevertheless, or maybe exactly because of this, the book with its' magnificently cute drawings and wonderful rhymes is even more beautiful. 
 A very important book to teach people (not just kids) about the importance of nature and the consequences of our actions!"

I decided to read it first to be sure it would not be too sad or troubling. I was pleasantly surprised to find an engaging mystery with action to boot. This is a book targeting a fifth grade audience and I felt it was a bit slow in the beginning, but by the end offered a lot of excitement. The clues and ending seem just right for a younger person to use their powers of deduction and prediction. Even I was unsure I had it all figured out in the end. I found myself hoping and hoping for the ending I wanted and just when it seemed to float out of reach, there it was for me. Floating in on butterfly wings I guess I could quip! If you are wondering about this book for a younger middle school aged girl- yes, it is a perfect match and one that should engage and enthuse a young reader with its charm. A satisfying read! It also came with a charm necklace which I will now wear since I have finished the book. Once my daughter has finished the book I will pass that necklace on to her for her to keep."

 One of my favorite Poems: 
 Hug o' War 
 I will not play at tug o' war 
 I'd rather play at hug o' war, 
 Where everyone hugs 
 Instead of tugs 
 Where everyone giggle 
 And rolls on the rug, 
 Where everyone kisses 
 And everyone grins 
 And everyone cuddles 
 And everyone wins."

I read it again today. (Side note for those of you who don't know Kohl's has 4 Dr.Suess Books and the green book for $5 each made on 60% recycled paper and the money goes to Kohl's cares for kids. They have new books every month) I thought it was fitting to have this title seeing as how it deals with saving the earth. I enjoyed reading this book again. I loved seeing the drastic contrast between life and no life. I love how it teaches the importance of caring for the earth and putting that decision in the child's hands. Dr. Suess did a fine job of conveying his message.

 When the two first meet, Findus is a kitten, bedded in a carton that had held Findus Green Peas, and labeled such. So Pettsson named the kitten after the label, naturally. 
 ""Hello Findus Green Peas,"" Pettson said, feeling just as when you pull up the blinds on a summer morning and the warm sunlight pours in. ""I'm Pettsson and this is my kitchen. You are going to live here now."" And then: ""Would you like some coffee?"" 
 Touches like that coffee, because Pettsson is an old Swedish bachelor, make the story special. Of course neighbor Andersson, giver of the kitten, teaches Pettsson enough about kittens to care for it properly. 
 What makes the series extra special is the art. Appealing, warm, detailed, and so funny. The books can be read over and over and the reader can still find more favorite bits to see in the pictures."

This is a good choice, imo, because they bring the story and characters to life - we feel like we know the king, we empathize with the page and the woodcutter. The scenes in the kitchen are downright humorous, but the 'bitter weather' is also drawn well enough to make us shiver. And the dog is so darling.

 Author: Eileen Rosenthal 
 Illustrator: Marc Rosenthal 
 Publisher/Date: Atheneum Books for Young Readers/ 1/25/2011 
 Pages/Format: 40/ Hardcover 
 ISBN: 9781442403772 
 When Willy woke up there was trouble. Where was Bobo? Willy needs Bobo. But, Earl the cat likes Bobo, too. A favorite toy is hard to share, even when it's a sock monkey. With sparse text and a modern-nostalgic vibe, this retro-fun book about friends (sock monkeys) and frenemies (devious cats) is an ode to favorite toys everywhere. Oh, Earl! Leave Bobo alone. 
 Willy has a stuffed monkey named Bobo. Bobo helps him with bitey-bugs, being afraid going down slides, walking past big dogs, but he can't find him. The grey cat, Earl had him under the covers. Willy being angry at Earl for this, takes Bobo back to get breakfast. Earl watches as Willy complains about the food, but as soon as Willy's back is turned while he is coloring, Earl drags Bobo away. Willy catches him in the act and takes Bobo away again. Willy decides to build a fort that Earl can't come in and as soon as Willy covers the fort, Bobo disappears. As Willy speculates and tries to find Bobo, you see Earl with Bobo's tail. Willy keeps looking and even questions Earl several times. And then he finds Bobo on the couch with Earl snuggled up next time him. Willy lays down with both of them, but the moment when Willy falls asleep Bobo is taken away again by Earl. 
 I really enjoyed I Must Have Bobo. This is a very true representation of what pets can and will do when they get attached to a toy or stuffed animal. Some of the pages remind me of Family Circle. Eileen and Marc Rosenthal are a great team together. The artwork is very simple but will keep the child on there toes with trying to help Willy find Bobo. 
 I recommend for anyone who has a child with a stuffed monkey, cat, both a child with stuffed animals and a cat that loves to steal them, loves Family Circle, and fans of Eileen and Marc Rosenthal's work.

 However, some of these poems contain real life-teaching lessons I never would have noticed had they not stuck with me for so long."

On the other hand, I don't think wind should really ruin playing pirate or knight and I don't think it was nice for the other woodland creatures to discourage his imaginative play. You don't need a cardboard castle to pretend to fight a dragon. Or a paper hat to be a pirate. And I'm pretty sure building a tower of cards outside is never a good idea. 
 But, if the wind hadn't made him grumpy during his other games, he wouldn't have been able to figure out the perfect thing to play with or have been able to share his idea with his friends. 
 I like the illustrations. The colors are nice, not overly bright, but not dull either. The cover gives a good example of the style. I also like how the pictures show us what happens when the wind blows, the text doesn't have to. 
 It's a good spring book and I think kids will be able to relate to Argyle Fox. He plays games they're familiar with and I can even see using his ""project"" as a start for one of your own."

I've never seen the animated movie and I've watched snippets of the Sy-Fy Channel's Alice movie. So when I saw the audiobook on sale in the iTunes store, I thought ""Why not?"". 
 Let me begin by saying the audiobook I downloaded was actually done extremely well. It was made by an acting group - the Wizard Academy Press , so each character had a different voice actor. I loved the narrator and the woman who played Alice. There was music and sound effects as well. For an audiobook, it was very engaging. 
 I knew it was going to be a little strange going in, but I was quite surprised by how strange. Science Fiction is usually not my thing, not that this is exactly science fiction, but neither is it fantasy. I usually like fantasy, but this book was just not my cup of tea. I do give the author credit for creating a very vivid and crazy world that created a comprehensive story line though. It was well written and to most people probably quite interesting. It did grow on me some the longer I read it, especially once Alice got out of the hallway and to the White Rabbit's house. 
 The story follows Alice after she falls down a rabbit hole. She goes through many adventures and meets numerous characters. She initially meets the White Rabbit, following him down the rabbit hole. Then she meets a few animals as she is swimming in the Pool of Tears. There is also the Hatter, the March Hare, the Dormouse, and the members of the pack of cards, with the King and Queen of Hearts as their leaders. Throughout it all, Alice is constantly growing and shrinking to fit the needs of the different environments and situations she ends up in. 
 If I were to listen or read it again, I would probably go with the written book just to make sure. However, I'm not sure I'm likely to read it again. Like I said, it wasn't really my version of an interesting book, just strange. Also, the majority of the time I spent criticizing Alice for being idiotic in my opinion. So like I said, not my thing, but I'm sure others really enjoy this book. I don't think I'd really let children under probably 12 or 13 read it because there are drug references, violence, and some more advanced topics, such as a philosophical discussion on time, that are scattered throughout the book."

I guess I had become a bit of a grinch myself, but re-reading it has helped me remember what Christmas should be about and recover the little girl inside me (I never forget her, but I don't listen to her much) I hope this book becomes one of my pupils favourites and they remember the first time they read it."

 Betsy-Tacy 
 and 
 What Katy Did 
 . I love how charming they all are, how quaint the language often is, and how different they are to the 'modern' (!) childhood I experienced. (I'm afraid there were no buying tiny chicks for a penny for me!) So when I saw that Mary-Mary was being republished, even though I hadn't heard of it before, I added it to my wishlist straight away. 
 Mary-Mary is a collection of short stories, originally published in 1957, about a girl who is the youngest of five children. There's Mary-Mary, Mum and Dad, plus her older brothers and sisters: Miriam, Martyn, Mervyn and Meg (and not forgetting her little pet toy mouse, Moppet). But unfortunately her family sometimes does not appreciate how creative, funny and smart their youngest member is. They think she's far too little to be involved in anything they're doing and will often tell poor Mary-Mary to go away and stop bothering them. 
 Mary-Mary is a lovely collection of witty and charming stories about Mary-Mary's mischievous adventures, accompanied by original illustrations that bring the tales to life. Mary-Mary is one of the most adorable little girls I've come across in fiction for a while. I loved her determination and uncanny ability to dismiss her siblings when they try to put her down, and she really does say some enchanting things: 
 ""It's much nicer being on the inside looking out,"" she said. ""Nicer than what?"" said Mr Bassett. ""Being on the outside looking in,"" said Mary-Mary. 
 ""Oh, go away!"" said Meg. ""Yes. Good-bye"", said Mary-Mary. 
 Mary-Mary is a lovely little thing who sometimes gets up to no good and embarrasses her brothers and sisters, but often with surprising and delightful outcomes, from dressing up as a lady - Miss Muffin - who likes being invited to tea, to going on a mission to earn threepence to buy an ice lolly. If you've read books like the old school stories by Enid Blyton or Milly-Molly-Mandy, you'll love this wonderful collection. Don't tell me you're too old! 
 If you've read any children's classics, do let me know as I'm always on the look out for more. 
 Thank you Hot Key Books for providing this book for review!

I enjoyed everything about this book, but especially the characters. Even the supporting characters were intriguing and a bit of a mystery. Main characters, Sam, Joey, and Roger are believable - equal parts engaging and frustrating, like many boys their age. They get into and out of and into trouble again and again while trying to solve a mystery. 
 Though the characters were a high point, I also enjoyed the cave where Jen and his uncle lived and the taste of Asian culture that we got throughout the book. Really great read for middle graders.

Of course Sloth moves veeery slowly, so as more creatures get into the debate, it seems that he's not going to do anything. The speculation runs rampant, but eventually all of the creatures, save Fox start to become bored. Then Sloth really does the very best thing. Read the book and discover what it is.

Her father left years ago and has minimal contact, her mother is depressed and close to catatonic much of the time, her eighteen year old sister Riley is angry much of the time, retreating into her music and her boyfriend. Their southern mansion is falling down around them and she doesn't think there's enough money left from inheritances to cover their bills. The final straw was the recent death of her grandmother who was killed on her way from the airport to visit after spending the past year and a half studying butterflies on a remote Pacific island. 
 When Tara sees a beautiful butterfly enter her bedroom the day after her grandmother's funeral. She swears the tiny creature is studying her. Another one isn't as lucky, Riley, thinking it's a moth, freaks out and kills it. Shortly after, a special delivery letter arrives for Tara. It's from her dead grandmother and hints that Gram knew that someone was trying to do her in and steal the secrets she had uncovered about special powers the butterflies, or as the islanders where she's doing research call them, nipwisipwis exhibit. The letter and accompanying keys, start Tara on an exciting, but sometimes scary quest to figure out who wanted her grandmother dead and what the secrets about the butterflies reveal. Her journey takes her and Riley, along with Reginald, the butler, Gram sent to keep watch over them while their mother rides out her depression. 
 Their journey to solve the mystery takes them first to the aging plantation her grandmother owned on a bayou and then way out in the Pacific to the amazing tree house her grandmother lived in. As Tara deciphers each subsequent clue and uses the accompanying key, tensions ramp up. In addition to solving the mystery, Tara gains an exotic boyfriend, discovers the amazing twilight flight of Gram's beloved butterflies, makes amends to some people she didn't treat very nicely and gets a huge surprise while avoiding a nasty fate. 
 This is a great reading adventure for juvenile readers who like interesting characters, a good mystery and just a bit of tension. Reading level is listed as grade five, but anyone interested in butterflies and a good plot will like this book."

As she grows up Sophie refuses to give up on hope; hope that her mother also somehow survived the calamity at sea. Music, Parisian starlit nights, and a sophic and somewhat unlikely guardian full of gnomic pronouncements on life all play a part as Sophie follows her dream. 
 Dry humour, wit and pithy observations on the way the world works ensure this keenly told story is a thoroughly enjoyable read. I personally found Sophie's unworldly guardian a little irritating, and the ending like a mounting crescendo left somehow hanging in the air, with a resolution too quick to enjoy as much as I had hoped I would. 
 Nevertheless, this is definitely a book to try if you're after something a little quirky and tender. If you enjoy this book I'd recommend you try Sarah Crossan's Apple and Rain - a very different take on longing to find one's mother - and Timothee de Fombelle's two Vango books for even more thrilling Parisian rooftop and skyward adventures."

In a sea of so-so stuff for the little ones, here's something new that rivals the likes of children's author greats Julia Donaldson and Lynley Dodd for top-notch rhyming tales with a lovely sing-song quality, full of interesting sounding words the little ones love, and great illustrations. 
 I was very impressed by this tale from Vikki VanSickle, where a little girl dreams of having a more interesting pet than her hamster - perhaps one of many mythological creatures she reads about. Taking us through a menagerie of magical creatures, we along with her come to realise that sometimes the best things are what we already have, and we don't need anything else. Lovely story, lovely verse, and lovely images.

 This is a very high three stars from me, especially towards the end, but I just couldn't bring myself to give it four. 
 The task set for the both of our main characters is that Narlaw demons are attacking and need banishing. It's easy to read, easy to follow, and some of the situations seemed a bit too easy to fix. Even for middle grade novel, the plot felt very simple, and while I found it to be a pleasant read, I wanted more from it. 
 Dawn is the Palace Whisperer and already knows her stuff but is yet to prove herself. On the other hand, Alice is an apprentice in a distant village. I thought we'd learn all about the Whisperers through her mentor, Moraine, and her teachings. But after letting us know that they are protectors who can talk to an animal and banish the Narlaw, we're away with the story and that's about as much detail as we ever get. It's such a good base concept but there's really not much to it at this stage. I like it, but it just seems a bit thin. 
 I liked the heroines. Both Alice and Dawn share the 'take action' quality that any protagonist needs. Again, we only see a slither of them. There wasn't much to connect to, like a socket with a hole missing. I wanted another hole, another dimension to their lives to make me understand them and feel invested. Usually books jump to 'love interest' but family, friends, or even hobby would do. 
 Like, like, like. Not love. 
 Maybe if Alice and her mentor Moraine talked a bit more about being a Whisperer then the reader would get a better sense of depth and become a little fonder of the relationship I assume they must share. Dawn grates with a few of the characters at the palace and by the end she really starts to show some power, but it was all too little too late. I get the feeling that further along the series Dawn might become my favourite character. 
 Ah, I almost forgot about Alice's wolf partner. I thought 'A Whisper of Wolves' would have more to do with....well... the wolves. They get a bit of a mention, but the title is a tad misleading now that I think about it. 'A Whisper of Birds' would make far more sense. 
 Don't get me wrong, this was an enjoyable book. You'll probably lap it up in one sitting, but an extra 5,000 words spent on character and world building would have been words well spent in my opinion.

 ISBN 0393245438 
 In 2015, Alice in Wonderland, the most beloved children's book of all time, turned 150. To celebrate Alice's birthday, W.W. Norton & Co. published an updated Deluxe Edition of The Annotated Alice.The Annotated Alice: 150th Anniversary Deluxe Edition is a lavish volume. It includes all of the original illustrations by Sir John Tenniel, as well as over 100 illustrations by many other artists, including Beatrix Potter, Arthur Rackham and Salvador Dali; all of the introductions to the previous editions, as well as an introduction to the 2015 edition by Mark Burstein who has carried on editor Martin Gardner's work after the latter's death in 2010; all of Carroll's writings about the books that appeared in his lifetime; and over 100 annotations resulting from new research since The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition was published in 1999 -- although, as Gardner himself points out, there can never be a truly definitive edition, as English professors, historians, logicians and readers around the world continue to research, speculate and argue over the multi-layered meanings of the Alice books.Making the case for all this meta-analysis, Gardner writes:""In the case of Alice we are dealing with a very curious, complicated kind of nonsense, written for British readers of another century, and we need to know a great many things that are not part of the text if we wish to capture its full wit and flavor.""He contends that Alice has endured only because of this interest by adults, and that children today are often ""bewildered and frightened by the nightmarish atmosphere of Alice's dreams"" (hence the recent proliferation of editions with illustrations for younger readers). 
 Alice's Adventures in Wonderland 
 The Annotated Alice illustrates the many aspects of Alice in Wonderland that relate to common ideas and expressions of the period, or refer to events in the lives of Lewis Carroll and Alice Liddell, the little girl Alice was based on.For example, as Alice fell down the Rabbit Hole, she thought, ""I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth!"" In Carroll's day, there was considerable popular speculation about what would happen if one did fall through a hole that went straight through the centre of the earth; this is just one example of how current Alice would have been in its day. (Carroll continued his interest in the subject in his later book, Sylvie and Bruno Concluded.)Alice's conversation with the mouse she met swimming in the Pool of Tears also drew from the world of 19th Century Oxford. She addressed the mouse in French, asking, ""Where is my cat?"", because ""this was the first sentence in her French lesson-book"". The Annotated Alice reproduces the first page of the 1804 textbook which Alice Liddell was studying at the time -- and the first sentence is indeed, ""Ou est ma chatte?""Some of the most iconic characters in Alice in Wonderland are the Mad Hatter, the equally crazy March Hare, and the perpetually grinning Cheshire Cat. Most readers would know that ""mad as a hatter"" was a common term in Victorian England, as the mercury used in curing felt could cause poisoning and the resulting tremors and hallucinations. But many wouldn't be aware that ""mad as a March Hare"" and ""grinning like a Cheshire Cat"" were also common phrases in Carroll's time. The expression ""to grin like a Cheshire Cat"" may have come from the fact that Cheshire cheeses were commonly moulded in the shape of a grinning cat, which no doubt appealed to Carroll's sense of whimsy.""You are Old, Father William"", the nonsense poem Alice recited to the hookah-smoking Caterpillar, is itself a parody of a long-forgotten didactic poem which is reproduced in its entirety in The Annotated Alice. In fact, nearly all of the nonsense poems in Alice are parodies of verses which would have been familiar to Carroll's readers; the originals are reproduced in the annotations. 
 Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There 
 When Lewis Carroll wrote Through the Looking Glass, Alice Liddell and her sisters were learning how to play chess. The annotations to this book begin on Carroll's preface to the 1897 edition, with a highly detailed analysis of the chess game on which the story is based. But this is perhaps taking literary criticism too far. As Martin Gardner points out: ""Considering the staggering difficulties involved in dovetailing a chess game with an amusing nonsense fantasy, Carroll does a remarkable job."" Gardner goes on to point out:""By a happy accident, chess also ties in beautifully with the mirror-reflection motif. Not only do rooks, bishops and knights come in pairs, but the asymmetric arrangement of one player's pieces at the start of the game... is an exact mirror reflection of his opponent's pieces.""Carroll was always fascinated by inversion, and incorporated back-to-front elements into many of the games he played with children, such as writing a letter back to front, so that the recipient had to hold the letter up to a mirror to read it -- in the same way that Alice had to hold the ""Jabberwocky"" poem up to a mirror.Martin Gardner reports that after the publication of Through the Looking Glass, there was a flood of Jabberwocky translations; a French and a German translation appear in The Annotated Alice.The Annotated Alice also provides a detailed etymological analysis of ""Jabberwocky"". Some of the words were, or were based on, archaic English terms; others were invented; while others, like ""to chortle"", were coined by Carroll and found their way into the Oxford English Dictionary.Gardner skilfully draws out the common themes in the two Alice books and Carroll's lesser-known works, such as the ""Sylvie and Bruno"" books and Symbolic Logic, highlighting Lewis Carroll's work as a mathematician and logician.The Annotated Alice presents the first publication of ""The Wasp in a Wig"", a section of Through the Looking Glass which was omitted when the book was initially published and only came to light in 1974 when the galley proofs were put up for sale at Sotheby's. 
 The End of the Tale 
 The Annotated Alice also includes information about Lewis Carroll Societies around the world; extensive references for keen Carrollians; a list of film adaptations; and notes about the illustrators featured in this edition.This lavish and incredibly detailed volume is a must-have for devotees of Alice and her fantastical world."

 Capn' Bones was a very arrogant character towards Jack, Annie and his other pirate mates.

They showed how courageous and sneaky they can be in escaping a situation that can potentially prolong for a long time. I am glad that they were able to figure out who M was and when M was talking about how the siblings brought the treehouse to life. All of the clues in the previous books make sense right now.

It was definitely the appealing characters that carried this one, and not any startling originality to the plot, though the plot is certainly perfectly pleasing, and things play out very satisfactorily."

My daughter age 7 who I refer to often as the kinder critic read this story to me and gives it a 5 star rating. A few challenging words for those advanced readers and a little longer than I had originally expected I give it 4 stars. Either way definitely a great story with a good moral lesson.

 This book i really liked because it was first very easy to read and you could understand what this book is proposing to you. The book was mainly about a boy named Robert and he and his friend Glenn are doing very mysterious stuff in the school because people say that it used to be a mansion once owned by a man named Tillinghast. So to find more clues they went to the school librarian who happens to be Tillinghast's sister. When they go there, they find a different woman who is more strict than usual. She looks like she could be the some person who works for Tillinghast but who knows. 
 Favorite Character: 
 Mac the school custodian because even though there is a huge blizzard there and he is the one who has to clean it, he was still very funny and grumpy at the same time. 
 Style of writing: 
 It was very nice and unique because whatever the book is telling you you can right on totally understand what there are saying which is really cool. 
 Time it took: 
 It took me about 1 week to finish this book because once you stop at one chapter you just want to keep on going."

But plans change when a huge winter storm (a ""nor'easter"") covers Dunwich in several feet of snow, trapping him and several others at the school. But something isn't quite right with the substitute librarian - she walks funny and wears too much perfume - and did a worm just fall out from under her sweater? 
 Big changes happen In this 4th book in the series, and not only am I beginning to think this book has less in common with the Goosebumps series than I previously thought, but I'm starting to like it even more (and I'm definitely not the target audience). Still, it's a short and easy read that might resonate with young readers who enjoy a fun and creepy story (of course, it's the covers that catch your attention in the beginning). I'm neither familiar with nor particularly interested in the references to the horror novels of H. P. Lovecraft, but I always liked a good monster story as a kid and it reminds me of some of the books I enjoyed back then."

From the very beginning when the evil (but ageing) sorceress Lady Lamorna is introduced thinking about ordering a new gown in black velvet, embroidered with spiders' webs, poison ivy and skulls, with 'rows and rows of dear little skulls sewn all along the hem' and 'layers and layers of blood-red petticoats' I knew I was at home (I want that gown too). But she needs gold to pay the Ancient Crones and her treasure chests are empty. The result is a plot involving blackmail, royal transfrogmification, deep villainy - on the part of Lady Lamorna, and courage - on the part of two delightful heroes, Gracie Gillypot, who has spent years suffering from her dreadful stepfather Mange Undershaft and his horrible, but beautiful daughter Foyce (a much nastier step-sister than even Cinderella had to deal with) but retains her good-humour, and Marcus, the Prince who really wants to be an adventurer. 
 They are helped by the delightful Marlon (a somewhat dodgy bat), his daughter Millie and Alfie (bat in training) and even find support in Lady Lamorna's troll servant, Gubble. It was, of course, written for children, but I loved it, and I am sure children (who can take a bit of scary stuff - werewolves, for instance) like it too. 
 There are four sequels. I have ordered the lot."

 This book could be good for independent reading or reading aloud-it has more pages than a picture book, however it does include pictures and I think a teacher could easily read it to their students during a read aloud time over the course of a week or two. It is very silly and I think that my students would enjoy the humor of it. 
 In his interest inventory, Haidyn said that he liked comedy. As I mentioned about, this book is very silly. It is fantastical in nature (could an 11-year-old boy really trick the United States into voting him for president by simply wearing a suit and a fake mustache with special powers???). There are a lot of hijinks and just plain silliness in the book-I laughed while reading it a few time. 
 I would show Haidyn the cover of the book-it's a cartoon drawing of a boy wearing a really big ""handlebar"" mustache. I'd mention that the mustache has mysterious origins and special powers. I would also tell him that the book is written by Tom Angleberger-the author of the Origami Yoda books-those are popular books that many kids Haidyn's age enjoy."

David, aka Scrub, is a kid from Florida sent by his suit wearing, overachieving parents, to Grandma's house for the summer. Between him and his friend Tyler there is no telling who is going to pull the win for the Collosal Summer Challenge. 
 His Grandma is a funky sort of woman! Someone who has one heck of a personality, soneone you'd definitely want to visit from the summer! There is a catchthough, she's an agging hippie with a certain sort of style. Not to mention lunch wouldn't be the main attraction, peanut butter & jelly won't be on the menu. Mix in the fact that she owns the in titled The Intergalactic Bed and Breakfast. This Inn doesn't only house Trekkie lovers, it's for full fledged beings from other galaxies. If the sheriff of the town finds out his grandmother will lose it all. Scrub isn't looking to cause heartache for his mother but the blanace between her secrecy and his need for attention will come into play.

Once I realized what they were up to, then it was: How will they do it? Panoramic illustrations and a fairly distant zoom on the scenes makes each spread a rich experience with details to savor, and when paired with a short and wide trim size (10x6 inches) each spread feels larger.

He lives in a village filled with other Wemmicks and every day all they do is give stickers to each other. The beautiful and talented ones get gold star stickers, and the chipped and ugly ones are given grey dot stickers. Punchinello has been given a lot of grey dots. He believes that this means he isn't ""a good wooden person."" When he meets Lucia, a Wemmick with no stickers- stars OR dots- he wants to be like her. ""I don't want anyone's marks."" She advises him to visit Eli, the woodcarver on the hill. At the workshop Punchinello begins to fear and turns to go home, but stops when he hears his name. Eli knows his name! As they talk, Eli reveals that he doesn't care what the other Wemmicks think of Punchinello. Eli thinks he's special. He also tells Punchinello that the stickers don't stick to Lucia because they don't matter to her. He asks Punchinello to come back every day to learn more. As Punchinello leaves, one of his grey dot stickers falls off. 
 * 
 What beautiful and true messages are shared in this book! The story is an allegory for us in our world today. We are constantly being told we are special or not depending on which of the world's standards we are being judged by. This can elevate someone or make them feel awful about themselves, just as it did to Punchinello. But as the story points out, it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks about you, only what God thinks about you. And He thinks you are pretty special. He knows you and He loves you. You're value is inherent, it doesn't increase or decrease based on the opinions of others. As you come to understand and trust that truth, the judgements of others don't stick, they don't affect you. 
 P.S I love the art!"

 Remember last summer when we had our Summer Reading kick off and movie in the parking lot? Anyone remember what the movie was? (There's a hint in the photo....) 
 That's right - Paddington! 
 But did you know that the movie was based off a book? A series of books, actually, written by Michael Bond. They're wonderful, as is the movie - and a real delight to read. 
 Like many classic books, each chapter in the Paddington series could be contained as its very own short story - but all the chapters are linked together with a larger story - though different than the movie! If you like stories where the main character always tries to do the right thing, but somehow always ends up messing up and creating a big mess - then Paddington is the story for you."

 Rascal is a favourite series in our house and the kids always look at the list of Rascal stories inside the front cover working out which books they have and begging me to buy the rest. 
 One of the best things about the series is watching the development of relationships through pictures. It is the story of a single-dad and his son Ben, and their neighbour Sherry, who is a pretty cool person willing to give anything a go. The series begins with them dating casually, we see Ben reacting to her presence (Rascal and the Bad Smell) and ... well spoilers."

Qualities such as delightful, expressive illustrations, short, funny stories, and great characters. I'm delighted to say that I have found such a series in this new series by Salina Yoon. I love the bright, colorful illustrations, they are very eye-catching and appealing. The characters make me smile and even laugh. And I have no doubt that young listeners/readers will love the fact that Little Duck is the one with all the good sense (in the first story, Little Duck is the only one who notices the dark clouds moving in as Big Duck and Porcupine plan a picnic). Each book has three short stories in it. In this first volume, the first story revolves around a planned picnic that goes wrong when rain clouds move in; the second story involves Big Duck trying desperately to remember something while Little Duck does his best to remind her what it is she's forgotten; and story three involves a camping trip that Big Duck makes way to complicated."

She's getting close to her goal but after working several jobs that she hasn't enjoyed, she's looking for something new to help her earn money. When her friend suggests babysitting, Kelly isn't really excited about the idea, she doesn't like kids after all. But anything for camp, so she agrees, and within the day her new status is posted on social media. But when a job for her mother's 'ice queen' boss comes up that night, Kelly is reluctant to give up the chance to go to a 'real' party where her crush will be. But she shows up to babysit young Jacob having no idea that her life will forever change when she discovers that monsters are real. Jacob gets stolen by monsters and Kelly teams up with a group of monster fighting babysitters to get him back before the night is over. But the Grand Guignol has big plans for Jacob, plans that may be more than Kelly and the babysitters can handle. 
 The story moves along at a brisk pace once the monsters make an appearance (which they do in the prologue). The story is over the top, exactly like you would expect for a story about teenagers fighting monsters. Included with the story are bits and pieces of a written record called ""A Babysitter's Guide to Monster Hunting"" that the characters use to fight the monsters. The illustrations do a fabulous job of adding to the overall creepiness of the book. A fun book for kids who enjoy horror and monster stories. 
 I get requests from students all the time for scary books. Of course, children like differing levels of the kind of scariness they enjoy. Because of that I tend to recommend a variety of books and then inform them to put the book down if it's too much for them. A Babysitter's Guide to Monster Hunting is a new book for me to recommend to students. However, it's one that I would recommend with caveats, because I found it really creepy. The action and adventure are pretty typical for this type of monster fighting story, that's not where I foresee some readers having problems. The problem is that the big villain: the Grand Guignol, otherwise known as the Boogeyman, is really creepy, in fact I'd say that he pushes the book from scary to horror. I do have readers who would enjoy this, but there are others who would not, so I'm adding this note to my review."

While she herself admits that she hasn't experienced this for herself, she has spent years working with children who have. Anais writes letters to her beloved grandmother who stayed behind in Africa while Anais, her mother, and her younger brother Jean-Claude have come to the states to find safety. Unfortunately, Anais's older brother and father remain in Congo, her father in hiding. Her father attempted to reveal the unethical and illegal things that the mining company he worked for was doing and as a result risked his own life and that of his family. Anais's letters show her confusion with the happenings at her school and 'crazy' America as a whole. Her struggles to learn the language, make friends, and learn the customs and traditions of her new country frustrate Anais greatly. But her grandmother's suggestion of finding one good thing about America to share in each letter helps her begin to see the good in her new life. 
 Those of us who've never experienced what children like Anais have need books like this one to help us catch a glimpse of what it's like. Ideally, as the author points out, these children would be telling their own stories, and hopefully one day they will. I enjoyed reading about America from the perspective of someone new to the country. And I definitely empathized with Anais's struggles to fit in as well as find a new home that she can love as well as she did her old home. The somewhat broken language and deliberate misspellings made it harder to read than some books but shows the reader what it might be like to try to communicate in a language you are just learning. An important story that would make for a great sharing opportunity."

Just when he's ready to give up, his mother encourages him to use his creativity and problem solving skills to come up with something to do that will work with the wind. While most adults will quickly figure out what Argyle is going to come up with, it is still a pleasure to see the little foxes' excitement and ingenuity on display as he uses all his previous toys to create something new. And when he turns around and helps his friends to find fun too, it's all the better. Themes of imaginative play, problem solving, friendship, and weather make this book perfect for a wide variety of story times. And the ""WOOSH"" of the wind makes for a perfect opportunity to get children interacting with the story. And the illustrations are adorable to boot."

Unfortunately, I find 'stupid' humor a bit irritating at times. Stick Dog is the only one of the five dogs in the story with any sense, the other four dogs are all clearly lacking in the thinking department (Poo Poo, Karen, Mutt, and Stripes). So when the dogs discover a hot dog cart and start planning a way to get the frankfurters, all but Stick Dog have really silly ideas (helicopter, anyone?). The fact that a band of raccoons is sneaking ever closer to the cart as well provides some competition for the dogs. A side plot involving Karen hiding in a laundry basket slows down the operation but doesn't end it. I can see young readers who enjoy the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series or Dork Diaries really liking the dumbness evidenced throughout the book, but it was a bit much for me. The illustrations are relatively simple but appealing."

He explains to the reader why he 'must have Bobo'. When he goes searching for his stuffed friend, he discovers that Earl, the cat, is also determined to have Bobo. 
 This is another fun book that showcases the independence of spirit that cats are known for. While Willy is willing to compromise with Earl, Earl is most definitely not willing to compromise with him. Anyone who has spent time around cats is likely to laugh or roll their eyes at Earl's persistence. A good read aloud that begs for the reader to 'become' Willy and share in Willy's attachment to his toy."

 As for the moral of the story, it's about learning to let go and allow yourself to grow. Now whenever my wife is down or in a bad mood, I can just tell her ""It's time to let your leaves drop,"" and she'll get this silly smile on her face. Any book that can do that is a good book."

Argyle Fox, with his signature style, wants to play outside on a springtime day, but the wind is wreaking havoc with his fun and games. As soon as he builds a card tower, climbs into a giant spider web, or takes up his pirate sword, here comes the wind: Woosh! Mama Fox tells grumpy Argyle that if he thinks long enough, he will come up with something to do. Following his mother's suggestion and inspired by her knitting, he works all the pieces of his day together and creates the perfect solution. 
 Argyle Fox is the story of a young fox determined to play outside, but the wind is making his favorite games impossible to play. I like that he has so many ready options, and that he is willing to keep trying. I was a little annoyed at the need for all the crazy cool props that Fox had to play with, rather than the use of pure imagination and playing with friends. HOwever, when he finally gets around to his final activity attempt he uses some of those props to build his new springtime toy. I understand that he needed some of that stuff to make that possible, and that it made his previous play attempts that much more heartfelt, but I still would have liked more imagination and less costume. That being said, I still loved the book and wish I had some of thase play props when I was a kid. 
 Argyle Fox is a well drawn picturebook with a nice blend of imagination, lesson sharing, and fun. I love the message about creative thinking and the need to keep on trying. I think it would make a nice addition to school and public library collections."

When the streets are empty and kids are called home for dinner and put to bed, the world becomes a magical place. The mischievous night children frolic in the twilight, rummaging for treasures and scattering surprises, stealing slices of the moon and dancing on rooftops. Only when dawn breaks do they tuck themselves away. But if you look very closely, you might just catch a glimpse of them disappearing as you wake up. 
 The Night Children is a beautifully illustrated picturebook that can capture the imagination. The text is lyrical, but the idea of night children, all drawn wearing monster-like hats, could either intrigue or frighten some children. the story could be an explanation for the shadows, sounds, and odd shapes that some children attribute to monsters, but I could see more adventurous children taking the story to heart and wanting to run with the elusive night children. The adventures of the night children answer many questions that children might have about the world around them, like unexpected changes in the landscape of odd sounds and movements. I think some young readers will love the flow of the story, and the splendid artwork, but I think it might be too abstract for others to really fall into and love. 
 The Night Children is a creative story about the unknown and imagination that some children will love completely. it just might fire up the imagination and creativity in some. However, I think some more pragmatic souls will not be quite so enraptured."

Toby's sister and baby brother love their schools; they smell great, like paint and rainbows. However Toby is not sure that he will like his new school at all. At first he thinks it smells more like ogres and he is lonely. He cannot seem to find friends, but he finds an alien, a mermaid, a dinosaur expert and a pirate. When his mum comes to pick him up he tells her that he did not make friends, but then who was he playing with? 
 My Stinky New School is a great picture book for children facing a new school or change in environments. While it might seem scary and like a place you do not want to be, giving the world a chance and being yourself will get you through. Toby is very nervous about his new school, and misses his family, but throws himself into his school day. By just being himself and being willing to talk to new kids he finds new friends. The book has humor and leaves the reader with a smile and feeling of comfort. 
 My Stinky New School is a wonderful book to share with a preschooler, kindergartener, or even first grade student that is experiencing some trepidation about the shift of schools and environment that they might be facing."

The story opens with Harry, Artie, and Billie waking up after being drugged and placed in trucks. They are on a train to New Orleans, with a note saying there are being sent to help a mysterious organization fight evil. When they arrive they discover the mayor is struck down with a mysterious illness and Billie's friends are being blamed for cursing him. Can they uncover the threat to the mayor and those under suspicion before they become targets themselves? 
 I would suggest reading the Young Houdini series in order, but I think you could pick up on the important aspects in Young Houdini: the Demon Curse without ruining your enjoyment if you do not want to track down a copy of The Magician's Fire, although I think you'd enjoy it. IN this adventure we are tossed into the action and mystery immediately. Who and what is the Order of the White Crow and why are they pulling the strings that put the three friends on their current path? What is really wrong with the New Orleans Mayor? Who would harm him and The Islanders? So many questions are formed at the start of the book, and they are swiftly added to. I will gladly saw most are answered by the end of the book, aside from those needed for the larger story arch. The suspense is high and Harry's small group find themselves is some very tight situations that I know I would have liked to avoid. The final resolution even surprised me a little, partially because of its multiple layers, which was a nice thing. My only complaint would be that there were a few background things that I doubt the historical accuracy of, which will not both most readers but might irk history buffs. 
 If you enjoyed The Magician's Fire, or historical mysteries, I would recommend picking up Young Houdini: the Demon Curse. The characters and action will grab most readers quickly, and will having them holding their breath as Harry, Arthur, and Billie work their way through another mystery and get themselves out of some seriously tight spots."

 This is the first book in the Caroline Year's series. They are based around Caroline Quiner the little girl that grows up to be Laura Ingalls' ma. This book starts out with five-year old Caroline and her family in their frame house in Brookfield, Wisconsin a year after their father, Henry Quiner, was lost at sea. These books are based on letters that Laura and her aunt Martha Quiner Carpenter exchanged about Martha and Caroline's life when they were young. I have always loved the Little House books and when I found out that not only was there a series for Rose Wilder people had also written a series for Caroline, Charlotte, and Martha. So I went right out and bought the ones I could get my hands on. The Caroline year's are definitely my favorite, not sure exactly why but they are. This book talks about all the trials and tribulations that this family goes through after their father goes missing. It also shows how little things really make a difference and all though they didn't have a lot they had enough and they had each other. These books always make me wish I could have lived back then. Even though they didn't have indoor plumbing and really no luxuries whatsoever. Caroline is such a sweet and inquisitive kid and she really thinks about how what she does is going to affect those she loves. This book also spends a bit of time in the winter, which in Wisconsin is pretty harsh. There is an early frost which causes problems because they didn't have any of their garden picked yet. But they make what they have last and get a few food surprises along the way. I wish the world was a bit more like this because no one really helps each other out with no thought for themselves the way they did in this time period."

It is mostly pictures, which capture a lot, and there's so much scary atmosphere throughout until the very end, which is adorable. As much as I loved that book, I never thought to look up any other books by Brown. This one I came across at work. See, my division of the Ministry of Education has everything do to with kindergarten, and at our divisional meeting our ADM (Assistant Deputy Minister) read this book aloud to us (it's a wonderful division, I love it there - no one else in the government gets picture books read to them at meetings!!). I borrowed it from him on Friday, but I absolutely have to get my own copy because it's an absolute gem. 
 One day when Pigeon arrives with the day's mail, she sees a big white X painted on the tree. As she delivers the mail to the tree's inhabitants - to Mrs Rabbit and her brood, to grumpy badger and Mr Squirrel, to Professor Owl and Maggie Magpie and, at the very top of the tree, Captain Crow who keeps watch with his telescope - she asks each of them if they know what the big white X on their tree means. None of them know; they're all too busy complaining about the pair of parakeets who are so noisy. Except, that is, Captain Crow. 
 Captain Crow has been watching the forest and knows that the trees with white X's painted on them will be chopped down. And, oh no! They can hear chopping noises already! But it's only Mr Woodpecker, cutting a hole in the tree for a new addition to his home. 
 This gives Pigeon a great idea, one that will get them all working together to save their tree. 
 This has to be one of the most beautiful picture books I've seen since Shaun Tan's The Red Tree. The illustrations take up the full two pages and are simply stunning, painted with a wealth of detail. As a kid, I could spend hours gazing at an illustration in a picture book, finding all sorts of little things and letting the story live like a play or movie in my head, even when I couldn't read the words for myself. As an adult, I still love spotting all the little details, and also admiring the artistry of the paintings. At the end, the last spread is a glorious pop-up of the entire tree and its inhabitants. 
 The story itself has a great message, one of cooperation, community spirit and environmentalism. A diverse range of characters live in close proximity to each other, often irritated by one another, but must come together to save their home. It is a great message for children, whether they live in dense, multicultural cities like Toronto and Sydney, or in the country where you could easily ignore your neighbours and become isolated and uncaring. The environmentalism side is clear enough, but the Old Tree also captures the ecosystem, the way everything in nature has its own qualities which work together to create, well, the planet as we know it. There's no need to drum these kinds of messages in; children pick up on them regardless. They're not stupid. 
 There's delight in the prose as well, which doesn't talk down to kids but helps them become better readers by being just challenging enough: 
 ""Good morning, Professor Owl. How are you today?"" 
 ""Dreadful,"" moaned the professor. ""I've got an appalling headache because of the screeching of those frightful parakeets, not to mention that remodeling fanatic downstairs."" 
 This is definitely the kind of picture book I'll want my kids to have, and I'll have to keep a look-out for more Ruth Brown."

I always knew about Paddington, but mostly because of my older sisters. I don't remember seeing the show (I'm pretty sure there was a cartoon) or reading the books. What I do remember is this story: 
 When I was about thirteen, we mated our kelpie sheepdog, Tess, with another farmer's kelpie. We got two male pups. One of my older sisters named them: one was called Paddington, the other, Bear. The names were perfect. Bear was the brave, spirited, adventurous one. Paddington was the cautious, sensitive, intelligent one. As the puppies got older, Bear decided he wanted to go out on the farm and learn to be a sheepdog like Tess. He was fearless. The problem was, Tess was a bit of a twit. She was our last sheepdog, and the worst. Actually, all the previous sheepdogs - most of which were border collies - were excellent. Tess though had this awful habit of, instead of obeying instructions and rounding up the sheep, she would race in front of the ute or the tractor, barking and snapping at the front tyres. 
 Bear learned from her. It wasn't long before he was dead, caught under the ute's tyres. It was awful. He was the most promising little puppy, a real goer, and if it hadn't been for his mum he would've had a long happy life of rounding up sheep. Now we just had Paddington. Once Bear was gone, he was like, Right, my turn. 
 And there went puppy number two, just like his brother. 
 There are a lot of shitty things that happen on a farm or station. I've helped deliver stillborn lambs; watched my dad slit the throat of an old, weak, nearly-dead ewe; hauled lambs around to be marked (which is actually lots of fun if you don't mind being kicked, smeared with shit, head-butted and having to watch their ears get clipped and tight little rubber rings put around the base of their tails and, if they have them, testicles); had all my pet lambs die on my except one (out of 30); smelled them burn on the open incinerator. And that's just the sheep. It's hard work, farming, and you learn about life and death from a young age - and learn to accept it too. But what happened with Paddington and Bear, that was hard. We never had pet dogs, only working dogs, but these puppies were adorable. We didn't coddle them - they slept with their mother in the kennel, which was just a dog box with a long chain to tie her up to, out behind the farmhouse. But like with all my pet lambs, it was just too sad. 
 So that's what I think about when I think of Paddington Bear. 
 For all that, or perhaps because of it, I feel very close to Paddington, and the book - which I finally got around to reading after all these years - is an absolute delight. It has a distinctly old-fashioned British flavour to it, featuring the kind of Pommy family that the Poms themselves make fun of but fondly. Paddington himself was just lovely. A honey-coloured bear from ""deepest Peru"", sent overseas on a raft with just his jars of marmalade and a sign from his Aunt Lucy that says ""Please take care of this bear"". Which is exactly what Mr and Mrs Brown and their two young children do. I kept getting an urge to cuddle him. 
 Paddington tries hard, but this world is new and exciting and just a bit confusing. He has many adventures, and it's often hilarious to see things from his perspective. They end well, these adventures, and yet there's always this slightly sad undertone. It's a funny story, quirky too, but very endearing. I'll have to look out for the other books in the series and start collecting them. Since Paddington is over 50 years old now (52!), and still going strong, I shouldn't have any trouble finding them."

Unfortunately, this is not a movie, this is not one of my ""once upon a time"" novels, this is little house, and though they have some of those simple pleasures that make you wish you were them, they don't have perfect lives.

He loves to hoard his treasures and keeps them hidden within the confines of his nest. When he comes across a paperclip one day, he decides this is a treasure he must definitely keep and hides it within the folds of his paper nest the first chance he gets. 
 When the paperclip goes missing the next day, he's determined to find out the culprit behind his treasure's disappearance. He's read enough of Sherlock Holmes, a story he found within the papers of his nest, to know what to do. Yet he wonders if he'll ever truly get to the bottom of his dilemma. 
 His best friend, Sarah the sparrow, offers to help him find out who's taken his treasure, even though she finds herself confused, every now and then, with Davey's references to Sherlock Holmes. She's never heard of the story and doesn't care for it, either. Nevertheless, Davey needs a helping hand and she's willing to follow him along in order to make sure his treasure is returned, safe and sound. 
 The two set off to discover the thief's identity, never once imagining they'd accuse someone unjustly. Their suspicions soon lead them to the home of Mr. Bushtail, but discovering whether he has Davey's treasure won't be easy. The squirrel is known to be greedy and keeps his home closely guarded. Nevertheless, Davey is determined to find out whether he's the culprit, once and for all, regardless of the consequences. 
 This was another great read for such a wonderful series. Full of beautifully depicted illustrations, the ease with which the story is told will draw in a reader of any age. Kudos to Emlyn for writing such a delightful series. I look forward to the next installment and recommend it to those who enjoy a story that brings out the child within us all."

 Loved the premise and the characters and I was well on board with the tale until it switched to Paris. At that point, I was disturbed by the danger of the ""roof topping"" and I felt like far too much of the action was spent with that, and not on the truly important things. I don't want to go into too much detail for fear of having spoilers, but I'll just say the end should have happened much earlier, and had some explanation! Overall, it was a very creative and magical book but I found it rather tedious and unfulfilling. It will probably be hard to convince kids to finish the whole book."

My adult self wasn't as invested (since I wasn't the target audience; my opinion doesn't count against children!), even though I appreciated the charm of the story. Matteo reminded me slightly of a childlike Han Alister, or perhaps a far more innocent version of a scamp from Oliver Twist. 
 Caught between the upper end of childrens' and lower end of middle grade, I'm shelving the book as childrens, although readers of both age groups might find something to enjoy with Rooftoppers.

He becomes very frustrated until he thinks carefully about his situation. Young readers will have fun predicting the activity that will ultimately be successful for the little fox. I remember trying to play Monopoly on our back porch as a kid, and having to put rocks on each of the piles of money and property cards to keep them from blowing away. So I can totally relate to the little fox's problem. The illustrations are warm and engaging and help make this a fun book to share with children."

 The book is based on the experiences of the author Saoussan Askar. When her home country (which is not named) became less safe to live in, her parents made the choice to move to Canada. There were things she didn't like at first, like the long plane ride, or the fact that she couldn't understand the teacher in her new school. The other kids try to help her, but the language barrier makes it difficult. She wants to quit school. Will she ever fit in? 
 This is a good book to read younger children who may have immigrant classmates. It talks about how strange and sometimes scary a new place can be. The illustrations are very nice and fit well with the story. 
 Saoussan originally published the book in 1995 when she was still young. A note from the author today tells what she has done in the time since the book was published.

So I picked up this book. It was an enjoyable book; I liked it. If you like Pinkwater's writing, you'll like this book. I did notice though after reading three of Pinkwater's book; he has a very distinctive writing style. 
 Walter and Winston Bongo are two boys who are bored to death in school and decide to Snark Out. Snarking out means that you sneak out of the house late at night and go to the Snark Theater to watch movies. They think they are the only ones who do this. That is until they meet Rat. Rat has been snarking out forever and she invites the boys over for breakfast. Rat's family is crazy and bizarre to the extreme and when Rat's avocado loving Uncle goes missing the boys are enlisted to help find him. Of course there are a ton of crazy characters; like Walter's avocado obsessed father and his mother who continually experiments with different types of tuna casserole for dinner. 
 This was a great, fun read. As I am finding to be the Pinkwater norm, the characters are unique and crazy, the plot is twisted and strange, and the imagination factor is off the scales. A quick read and hilarious; I think all ages will enjoy this book. 
 The only thing that bugged me a bit was that Walter's dialogue and thoughts were very similar to Neddie's from ""The Neddiad""...this is odd because these books were written over 20 years apart. It make me wonder if Pinkwater uses a similar dialogue and character style for all of his young boys. Also Rat reminded me a lot of Iggy, the girl character in ""The Iggyssey"". That being said I still really enjoyed the book. 
 I will definitely read more of Pinkwater's books. I did not think this book was as good as ""The Neddiad"" though. Despite that this book was great fun to read."

After reading the description it sounded amusing, so I picked it up from the library. This is the First Tale from the Five Kingdoms by Vivian French. Last I heard she was contracted for five books in this series. It was an amusing read. 
 The Sorceress Lady Lamorna wants a new gown, but she doesn't have any gold. So she devises a plan to turn princes into frogs and blackmail their parents to pay her money to turn them back. Unfortunately she doesn not factor in all the trouble the people she meets will cause her. 
 This book is completely tongue in cheek. All the characters are way over the top and completely stereotyped. For example Gracie Gillypot, the Trueheart, can find happiness in the most grim of situations...even if that situation is being locked in a dark, dank cellar. The Lady Lamorna is your typical evil queen villain sort. If you don't like over-the-top, excessively crazy characters than this is not the book for you. 
 The book is well done and engaging, as well as a quick read. The whole book has a sharp wit to it that is highly amusing and is told in a very fairy tale-like manner. There are pictures in each chapter that are well-done and fit the crazy fairy-tale demeanor of the writing. This was also a very quick read, maybe two hours at the most. 
 Overall I enjoyed it, chuckled some, and rolled my eyes at some of the overly blatantly craziness and silliness. At points it almost gets too silly, but never quite manages to cross that line. If you like zany fairy tales with overly dramatic and ridiculously stereotyped characters then you will get a kick out of this book. If you aren't into that sort of craziness I would look for something else. I will definitely read the next book in this series ""The Bag of Bones"". I am not sure if I will read beyond that because I think this level of silliness might get old quickly; we will see. For this book though I enjoyed it."

Ever since I heard Tom Angleberger speak in Kansas City, I thought he was a kindred spirit. Though I'm sure he doesn't use that term. Tom had the whole audience fold an origami yoda. It was the most fun I've had in a long time. So when I got this book to read to my kids two summers ago, I wasn't sure how they would take it, being a little young. They loved it! I have a movie of them saying ""Fako Mustach-O"" and laughing for about five minutes. I tried to post it to Tom's Facebook page, but alas technical difficulties. So anyway. This book is a game changer. It's exactly the kind of book I was always looking for a child reader: fun, quirky, scary, and super awesome. Every kid should own this book and I totally credit Tom Angleberger for bringing the fake mustache back into fashion. Ever since I read this book, I've seen them everywhere."

The author wants us to think about those around us who have not heard the Gospel yet. It's an admirable goal, but occasionally the lesson is so forced it becomes almost a sermon and not a story.

I was in the Baton Rouge school system, and we used Alice and Jerry books throughout elementary school. For some reason, this one stuck with me more than the others. It could be the combination of the quality of the book coupled with the great teaching skill of Mrs. Ash, who commuted from Centerville, Mississippi, to teach us each day that year. Though the books were written by Mabel O'Donnell, I read somewhere that some of the stories in this one were adaptations of the Little House stories by Laura Ingalls Wilder. Another thing that is impressive about these books is the illustrations. Thanks for that goes to Florence and Margaret Hoopes. I'm giving it a five-star rating because it left such a positive impression on me for all of these years. That's a long time, as I will retire next year."

 McKenzie's tale dives a little deeper than most in the genre, as it explores the despair and fear of the protagonist, Sam, who has lost his parents and whose only living relative doesn't seem to want him. What begins as a bid for freedom and to stay with his friends so he can play in a baseball championship turns into an exotic treasure hunt with elements of the supernatural."

I just finished reading The Blind Watchmaker, and I recognised many of the points and examples from there in the first part of Loxton's book (he even drops Dawkins' name a couple of times for some reason--like instead of saying ""biologists"" or ""scientists"" think he says ""biologist Richard Dawkins thinks""). One significant omission was the discussion of ring species as evidence of evolution that we can see in real time. 
 The second part was a take down of common creationist talking points, presented in a question-answer format. Most of these were rather good, explaining things well in a short space without being either condescending or too abstruse for the target audience. I did however, think the answers to the final two questions were a bit weak and a little too much on the side of accommodation. 
 The first dealt with abiogenesis, and instead of being quite firm that though the details are sketchy, scientists have arrived at several plausible methods whereby living cells could have evolved from self-replicating chemicals. Instead, he stresses the fact that we don't yet know how it happened, making it sound like we have no real clue at all. At least that's how it came across. Okay, but not strong enough for my taste. 
 The second question was the one about religion. I mean, if he's going to bring up religion at all he shouldn't take the ""non-overlapping magisteria"" tack. It's rather a cop out. It's wrong to tell kids that ""science as a whole has nothing to say about religion"". It's an easy thing to say, and might prevent your book being banned by anti-intellectual parents, but it's just not true. Science has plenty to say about religious claims: in the form of evidence-based history and archaeology, in the form of controlled studies of the efficacy of prayer, miracle claims, in the form of the study of neurology and the human brain to determine whether there's any evidence for body/spirit dualism, in the study of anthropology and sociology to figure out how religion develops and operates in society and in diverse human cultures...you get my point. Sorry Daniel, ""your family, friends and community"" are not the ""best people to ask about religious questions"". You want a kid to develop critical thinking skills? Don't tell them to ask questions of people who may have a biased interest in selling their own religion, and say they're the best option. Tell them to be critical and ask some experts or read some books by experts on those subjects. 
 --- 
 Also, very important to consider when evaluating children's books: 
 Presence of Sexism - A 
 Men and women, girls and boys are presented fairly equally. Loxton seemed to make an effort to include a female scientist by talking about paleontologist Mary Anning. So overall, a good job. 
 There is a page talking about hominids and the misleading ""March of Progress"" image which would have been better had it included both a man and woman in each place. 
 Presence of Heterosexism - mostly N/A 
 As sex was hardly mentioned at all aside from a couple of places where we would have to infer it (e.g. he uses a compromise in tail lengths as an example of balance between selection for speed and selection for sexual attractiveness, but doesn't actually ever explain sexual selection). 
 Presence of Racism - B+ 
 There's quite a bit of diversity among questioners, but when humans were the subject that was being discussed, the illustrations were of white people only, and the March of Progress page still made it look a little bit like modern humans in the form of white people (actually men) were the ""most evolved"" or what have you. Definitely not the impression he was trying to make, but it could come across that way subliminally. 
 My rating: 7.5/10"

 Davey is a curious bird that loves detective mysteries and shiny objects. One day he finds a treasure and loses it.

I think this is a great book for children because it teaches them to go on adventures and explore mysteries that happen all around them. It also teaches them not to blame people for things that they have not done and not to assume the worst in people. I love the fact that the author made several references to Sherlock Holmes."

 3.75 stars 
 This book, in my opinion, was made to be read aloud. 
 I enjoyed it greatly. Some of the poms seem quite nonsensical while others have powerful messages. I'll now list some of my favorites:

 -Listen To The Mustn'ts 
 -Hector the Collector 
 -Enter This Deserted House 
 -Where The Sidewalk Ends 
 -No Difference 
 -Alice 
 -Forgotten Language 
 -Don't Tell Me 
 That may seem like a lot, but I promise there are many I didn't mention. Also just because I didn't list them here does not mean I didn't enjoy them; I just enjoyed them slightly less than these.

 She definitely had quite an adventure going to Paris to look for her mother, who everyone else thought to be dead. I also liked the idea of orphans and runaways living on the roofs of buildings all over Paris. I loved her relationship with her guardian, Charles, and how he let Sophie be who she was, even though others thought it wasn't proper for a single man to be raising a young girl, and that she wasn't acting the way a young girl should. But I love that Sophie's a free spirit, and that she believed her mother was still alive, even when others believed it wasn't possible. 
 And so Sophie finds herself in Paris, where she meets Matteo and his group of rooftoppers. They help her find her mother, while having some adventures along the way, and I did like seeing Paris from a very different perspective than what you'd normally see. 
 I'm a bit conflicted about the ending. I mean, I didn't like that the book just kind of ended with Sohpie meeting her mom, and that we got a little bit of what happened with Sohpie after finding her mom. Especially because that's what the book was building up to. But it's also a good place to end the book, and you're wondering what did happen. So it being a little open-ended is both interesting and slightly annoying. 
 Final Thoughts: Rooftoppers is cute and charming, and I couldn't help but like Charles and Sophie. Rooftoppers gets 4 stars."

 This is a thoughtful examination of the difficulties faced by Sasha, a girl in care, who has been moved around by the system between foster parents, children's homes and a failed adoption, until she arrives at a farm with reasonable, caring owners. The overlying structure draws a convincing parallel between her situation and that of Meteor, a nervous horse who has come to the farm to be trained. He is over-sensitive and easily panicked, and it takes considerable effort from Sasha to gain his confidence. Sasha has been told she cannot stay on the farm, even though the foster parents are understanding, recognise her dyslexia and help with her schoolwork, and most importantly, teach her to ride. The story is skilfully told, with much empathy and compassion, and ends with a powerful emotional punch."

This time, Winston's school has been selected to compete in a puzzle competition sponsored by the quirky snack-food maven Dmitri Simon (think Willy Wonka of the salty foods empire). The mystery this time: solving the six puzzles, and finding out who the cheater is who's been sabotaging the other teams. 
 In the first Winston Breen book, the puzzles were dropped in more or less at random in Winston's treasure hunt; here there's a more organic part of the story, and for obvious reasons. As a result, this volume is less gimmicky than its predecessor. The extra puzzles--the ones outside of the competition--are dropped in where Winston is killing time traveling from place to place, or while waiting for people, or in other such places, instead of (actual example from the first book, as best I remember) ""I'm trapped in a burning basement, and here's the puzzle it reminds me of!""

 This book has been around since 1973, long before the movie ""My Girl,"" so you may already know the premise: The narrator's best friend, Jamie, dies from a bee sting. To make it worse, the narrator knows how Jamie always acts out for attention, and gets fed up with it. No one, not even Jamie, knew that he was allergic to bee stings, so when a swarm of bees goes after the neighborhood children, the narrator goes home to have a popsicle and have a break from Jamie's antics. 
 This is a short, deceptively simple book that deals with death (especially the unexpected death of a friend) in a straightforward, honest manner. 
 Favorite quotes: 
 ""Did the world know that Jamie was dead? The sky didn't act like it. It was a blue-sky and white-cloud day."" 
 ""I remembered when Jamie and I first learned that the world revolved. We had plastered ourselves to the ground, with our arms stretched wide trying to feel the movement. Now I put one arm across my middle and pretended the rest of me was out straight, stiff. I couldn't make myself feel dead any more than I could feel the world spinning."""

They're fun and adorable and have just the right amount of anxiety/neurosis to appeal to my over-analyzing brain. I would have loved this as a kid. I like that each book shows Scaredy Squirrel conquering a fear and having it all end up pretty great- definitely shows that sometimes facing fears leads to some great results.

The original kids are back which was lovely, but they're largely relegated to unimportant background stuff. You get the distinct feeling that Merry and Will could have handled this one without them (convenient wish and that lil bit of scrying aside). 
 I don't know. This book is 99% what I don't like about Coopers writing. She tells and doesn't show. Or she uses a passive narrator. She did the same thing at the end of the previous book, which I thought was a bit of a cop out, but I figured it was just because the had a tonne of info dumping to do there. 
 I also don't like what she's doing with Will's character. He has become this all-knowing grown up after reading that book in DiR, and it's turned him into quite a dull unconflicted boy. I think this Merlin-esque persona suits Merriman but Will just reads like he's 12 going on 80. He's not really scared & he knows how to handle everything. 
 The worst part is the basic story is less interesting now too. I mean the whole grail finding business feels like it should be the start of a mystery not the entire content. There's still some excellent visuals (the ceremony of the green witch, the caravan at the ruined farmhouse, the painter in the storm) but I'm overall I'm pretty disappointed."

It has a tiny front porch, a loft for stargazing when one cannot sleep, and a big green truck to take it everywhere it wants to travel. Tiny's owners purged their belongings to fit Tiny's small interior, and then hitch up to the green truck to travel and see the sites. Every day was grand until Tiny meet Missy Manson at the top of a hill. Missy is old-fashion and held one belief, which she told to Tiny, ""You can't be home if you don't stay in one place."" 
 Tiny House is an interesting picture book. Its illustrations are bright and cheerful. Tiny and the other tiny houses are true to the tiny houses I have seen. The lovely farmhouse sits in front of rows of hay. Time goes by, the house is placed for sale, and, as the next spread shows, it never sells, but now sits in decay with a large urban setting in its backyard, nearly encroaching upon the farmland. I hate to see such change, but Fletcher shows the contrast perfectly in the two spreads. Every page speaks well of the tiny house movement with its beautifully imagined and composed spreads. 
 Aside from showing kids the exciting tiny homes being built and driven around the country, it asks one important question: Where must a house be located in order to be called a home? 
 Those who have a tiny house or love the tiny house movement will enjoy Tiny House. The Big Adventures of Tiny House is a great choice for kids reluctantly moving, or who have two homes with two divorced parents and are not sure which is actually ""home."" Tiny finally learned, it didn't matter whether home was on a big hill or on four wheels behind a big green truck, what mattered was where you and your heart are--that's home.

His mother said, ""It looks windy out. I think the cards will blow away."" Argyle harrumphed as he walked outside to build a card tower. As he placed the final card--the one that would make this the largest card-tower ever--a wind gust rose up and whooshed by, taking with it Argyle's tower of cards. ""Not fair!"" was all Argyle could think to say. 
 Argyle's day continued much the same . . . 
 Le Tourneau's illustrations are windswept. Being in the forest, there is a generous amount of greens and browns, but Argyle's red coat offsets this background, making him stand out to readers. As the wind curls around trees and upends Argyle's plans, readers can clearly see the source of Argyle's frustrations . . . 
 Argyle Fox is perfect for kindergarten classes where they can try out each of Argyle's games. Kids can learn first-hand how failure can lead to success. Kids will enjoy Argyle's little outbursts after the wind has destroyed yet another game. ""Not fair! Phooey! Grrr. Rotten wind!"" Argyle uses creative language rather than bad words to express his feelings . . .

The artwork is delightful, full of life in spring medium shades, nothing bright. The line work is simple but evocative. 
 Argyle Fox simply wants to play outside and enjoy the beautiful spring weather. Sounds simple, right? Yeah, not so much. The wind keeps interfering with his attempts to play outside. Although he has good ideas for his outside play, he fails to account for the wind and thus his plans fall apart. We see his frustration and his sadness at his repeated failure to play in the wind. His mother offers advice which he ponders and finally, he just may have a found a way to play outside without the wind interfering. The style was not preachy, but still too much of a message story for my liking. Some children will enjoy the games and ideas that Argyle comes up with and may laugh at the wind's behavior. Others may wonder what takes him so long to come up with an answer to his problem."

Oh well. Now that I think of it Scooby-Doo doesn't really solve murders either. So I guess he and Nancy do have some things in common. 
 This is obviously the first Nancy Drew book I've read. Even though she didn't solve a murder like I expected, she did help find a missing will. If you haven't guessed by the name of the book, the will was hidden in the old clock. But, Nancy goes on quite an adventure to find the clock. 
 Even though the book was predictable it was still charming. Nancy has her stuff together. This girl right here can change a flat tire and fix a boat motor while stranded in the middle of the lake. Now I know why so many women look up to Nancy as a feminist heroine. She's super smart and always polite and tactful to boot. Not to mention she's fashionable. 
 I enjoyed this book and was able to read it one sitting, while trying to put a baby to sleep. The book was cozy and probably paved the way for the cozy mystery genre that is so popular today. I say probably just because I really don't know anything about the history of cozy mysteries. 
 I am giving The Secret of The Old Clock 4 out of 5 stars."

 In this prequel, Jenny discovers her abilities and is quickly whisked off into a world populated by dragons and sprites. The dragons are stealing from the sprites and in turn the sprites are attacking the dragons. The dragons are retaliating by burning down the forests, and Jenny is recruited to end the war and help the two groups find a truce. 
 I think, based on the prequel, that this series would really appeal to younger middle grade girls, around the same age as the main character, who have huge imaginations but just enough attention span for a fun story. 
 I'll probably at least give the first book a chance and see where the author takes things."

I think that it is amazing for an adult to be able to capture exactly what teenagers go through and for that understanding, I do thank Judy Blume from the bottom of my heart. She is a very accomplished writer for young adults. 
 I wrote a longer blog post about growing up, referring to this book and another by Judy Blume called 'Are you there God? It's me, Margaret'. The two books that have etched themselves into my teenage heart that has now matured but not forgotten.

The central relationship, between foundling Sophie and her guardian Charles, is three-dimensional, quirky and likable. The rooftop descriptions leave no doubt about their authenticity. Don't read it if you're scared of heights. 
 I felt the story lost some momentum at the end, though. It seemed to be building to something bigger that didn't materialise; either that or it didn't need quite so many loops. At times I felt we were being artificially kept away from the story's climax. But mostly, an enjoyable and touching read."

I thought the title was a bit babyish, and think if I was the author I would think up a better attention-grabbing title. The book starts off with Calandria (Callie for short) Richards, an almost -twelve -year -old, waking from a dream in which her mother, who died two years previously, has the face of the Raven Queen, and she is in a magical land full of unicorns and dragons. It is the day of her twelfth birthday. 
 She lives with her dad and a dog called Bo. The same morning before school, she notices her alphabet cereal starts forming words, and talks about a mysterious land called Albion, of which she is the Princess. She confides in her best friend Lewis about this, and he is sceptical at first but then believes her. I found also at the beginning, there is not much character development, so it is hard to imagine what each character would look like, or would even be wearing. There are some grammar issues with two dashes either side of a sentence containing a character's inner thought, which I have not seen used before. The story gets better after the beginning. The storyline is fast-paced, but enjoyable."

The author gave young readers a good deal of reasoning credit. While there are clearly Christian principles being expressed, it isn't heavy-handed or over explained. The gist being that what others think of us--good or bad--doesn't matter unless we ALLOW it to matter to us. 
 I liked the softly lit, watercolor and pastel feel to the illustrations. My children were a little off-put by the exaggerated proportions of the Wemmicks, finding them a bit creepy initially. But we pressed on and they acclimated to the art style. 
 My one complaint would be that the story ended a bit abruptly. It would have felt more symmetrical to wrap it up with more completion in just a few pages, instead of leaving resolution largely to the imagination. (My kids did notice this, and asked if the rest of the story was in a different book.) It looks as though this book belongs to a series, so perhaps there is more satisfaction to be found in later installments."

I mean, it could be a great book for those parents who have young children they can read this book to.

 When I was a child, I was never introduced to Paddington Bear and there was one bear in my life and that was Winnie The Pooh. It wasn't until I saw promotions for the upcoming Paddington movie that I decided I needed to see what I had missed out on as a child. This is the type of book that I would've loved when I was younger -- the type of book that would get reread and reread until all of the pages became frayed and bent out of shape. A Bear Called Paddington is an absolutely adorable book with such superb illustrations and a humorous main character, this is a book that parents and children will enjoy alike. 
 Paddington Bear is a sweet, harmless anthropomorphic bear who is always getting into shenanigans. From the moment he is found at a British train station, he becomes an integral part of the Brown family and holds a place in the reader's heart. I can definitely see why Paddington has become world-renowned and why countless people have already fallen in love with the bear from Darkest Peru. 
 A Bear Called Paddington is such a fantastic book that truly transcends it's young age group and is a book that can be enjoy by 3 year olds or 83 year olds. Despite the fact that Paddington is over 50 years old, his story still feels fresh and relevant in this day and age; everyone can relate to those awkward feelings of being new and out of place. I am extremely excited to see how this book translates to the big screen and I hope that the filmmakers have done lil ol' Paddington justice."

 Anyway, the book tells of how he ends up at a train station in London and is taken in by a British family..He is quite attached to his possessions and seldom leaves his suitcase behind..Extremely fond of marmalade or anything in that flavour, he is actually very friendly and polite..His curiosity often lands him in pickle..But thanks to his strong sense of right and wrong, he is quick to clear the misunderstanding,

 Each chapter is an account of his adventures and unintended mishaps..which he just can't help getting himself into..And he gives the reason himself, 
 ""Things are always happening to me. I'm that sort of bear."" 
 This book is about a bear, who is law unto himself..He is hilarious without meaning to be and he is adorable in his steadfastness..A bear story worthy of being on every child's bookshelf!! :D"

As the temperatures continue dropping, danger awaits around every corner....and one among them is not what she seems. 
 What I loved most about this book was the relationship between Robert and Karina, the friendly ghost of the school. We get to see a lot more of her in this story. She is struggling with the fact that everybody can see her, but she cannot escape with the rest of them and the questions that will bring when they do escape. 
 When the school drops below certain temperatures, creatures from hidden places begin to infest the school and keeps them on the run. Not only trying to survive the weather, but running for their lives, a true hero will emerge in the end, and a dream come true. 
 The Lovecraft Tales are very fun, creep-tastic reads that show a variety of family and friendship relationships as the stories continue."

I so fell in love with the cover and the description that I was ready to cry if I had been denied for this one. But thankfully I was approved for this book. I'm so glad I requested this book! 
 The Night Children tells about when children have gone home and it is dark out. The Night Children come out and take over for the Day Children. They steal slices of the moon, scatter leaves, cause the cats to sing etc. Till it is time for them to go to bed and time for the Day Children to take over. 
 Wow wow wow wow wow! Did I say wow? Cause holy freaking wow! This book was AMAZING! No, seriously! I wish that I had read this book in time for my top ten books I've read so far this year list. Because this would have been on there. 
 Let me start with the illustrations. They are some of the best I've seen so far this year. They have a fluidty to them that is hard to describe. I can just see the movements of the Night Children in the drawings. You can see their graceful almost dance like movements. You can see the wind whipping the leaves that they tear up and scatter. This is sheer perfection. From the tiny details to the color choices. This is the type of book that tells a story without having any words. 
 Ah, but we can't forget the words can we? The story itself is wonderful. This is a simple easy to read story but yet it tells of the magic of the Night Children. I think this book would be best told in the fall time as the imagery of the words and artwork go with that time of the year. Also as I was reading it I could totally see a mini animated short made out of this. It totally flows like the best animated art films. 
 My son loved this book as much as I did. He stayed with me while I looked back through the photos and would complain if I moved to fast for him. He wanted to soak it all in. 
 5 out of 5 enthusiastic stars!!

The pace was so non-stop that I found myself wishing that a break in the action about 3/4ths through was the end (which is also when different characters got their own chapters and the story didn't flow quite as well). I enjoyed the siblings' relationship - their funny bickering and fierce love for each other. The explanation of the time travel was a bit befuddling - easier to just accept how it is and move on (which the author practically advises). 
 This was my first audiobook narrated by Jim Dale, and I understand why he's so popular. His various character voices were great.

I didn't know about Jackalope so I was happy to learn about that creature. Otherwise, the book didn't stand out much and the short poem is simply a fun version of a classic poem. I found the jackalope reprensation and illustrations cute and amusing but some pages of the e-book were better than the others. Flipping throughout the pages were confusing too. In fact, when I flipped the first page, it gave a fast version of the entire book and then the 1st ''chapter''begins and I didn't know what was going on.

Lenny Jr. goes to buy a special mustache his best friend Casper desperately wants; The Heidelberg Handlebar #7. When Casper dons the mustache he finds that he has specials powers and can talk anyone into whatever he wants. He quickly takes over the world and it is up to Lenny to stop him with the help of television star Jodie O'Rodeo. They race through this rip-roaring adventure using gadgets from a Willy Wonka-type factory that involves boogers, chicken-tasting erasers, and more. Take a chomp out of this one, but place your disbelief outside the door - its wacky humor is out there. 
 Red and Jodie have the best lines. Red has a string of implied non-shocking swear words that go something like this, ""Are you boys selling candy bars for your gottdangled school? No more candy bars! Get the Helchfitz out of here!"" He tells the boys his brother died over one hundred years, calls Lenny a ""FarDobbled Candy-Bar-selling Punkler"" when he looks at hats, and pets the money Casper gives him for the suit. I haven't met such a fun, crotchety character since Yosemite Sam - the cartoon king of irreverent comments. 
 If Red is Yosemite, then Jodie is Annie Oakley except she slings water pistols versus guns. Check out Jodies gun-slinging slang. I'm reading along from Lenny's point of view when ""Kablammo!"" I get Jodie's point of view. She's on a rescue mission and loves using variations of the word ""ding-dang."" We've got ""Who the ding-dang-dong are you?"" or references to her ""...ding-dang TV show"" or there's ""Ding-dang dude, can't you be more careful?"" She's a lovable ding-dong that's fer sure. Other fun words are ""goshamighty, cockamamy, kablammo, (yes I borrowed that one), giddyup, woolbusters,whoop-de-doo, bojangles, heinies, and twinkle-toes (she didn't use that one but I think she should have or maybe it should be twinkie-toes in honor of Hostess treats). Jodie can toss a knife like a circus performer but she doesn't want to hurt anyone so she lets the handle hit the villain between the eyes. She's a keeper, this one.

In Hibernation Station Michelle Meadows reveals what the forest animals do. They hunker down for a long winter's nap in the hollowed out tree log train cars. Things go wrong with the woodland animals are put into wrong cars, eventually leading them to all snuggle together in a nice warm log together. 
 With cute illustrations and fun rhyming words, Hibernation Stations is a story that's great for reading at nap time or bed time. This is a story my little girl enjoyed. She loves seeing the animals in their pjs. I think this is a story that's great for toddlers and pre-school ages kids. I like that the author, Michelle Meadows included a helpful note about hibernation in the back of the book."

Many days children would walk 10 to 20 miles a day beside the wagons over a five month period. You will learn possible names children were given, the types of clothes they wore, chores they had to do and what they ate along the trail. Boys milked the cows while the girls picked up cow patties for the fires. Most of the time you slept outside under the stars. Once reaching Oregon families could claim 640 acres of free land. Then the really hard work began of building a cabin, farming and going to a one room schoolhouse. School time was determined by planting and later harvesting. Many other tidbits of information are included. Famous people from that time period are highlighted in the back of the book as well as a glossary of words from that time. 
 This is a great resource for children, especially if they need to write reports for school history assignments

 I have vague and hazy memories of watching the TV series as a child - not really any memories of the plot but a sense of darkness and gloom and running from something terrible. I haven't seen the more recent movie adaptation but might seek it out now. 
 Despite the book's age it didn't feel particularly dated (a reference to tolls on the harbour bridge about the only thing that I found jarring). It has a great sense of adventure and suspense and the Wilberforces were particularly creepy with their rubbery grey skin and morphing abilities. I also loved the science fiction element (grey slugs on a mission to turn the universe to mud...been watching too much Dr Who....could picture Jones as a companion lol). 
 I did find it a bit simplistic at times and a bit short - the ending is quite abrupt - but I think if it is viewed as middle grade/children's fiction rather than YA (something I tried to keep in mind while reading) then it works Ok. I have given this to my 11 year old to read next."

cef318a1b77aec458abdad3502335657,160629,fdfecaa70bf11e673a1ed8d9cb5a6a5d,5,"From the very first pages I loved Paddington. There is just something about his sweet, well mannered and innocent nature that makes him special. While there are many books dedicated to the adventures of Paddington this is the first, and the one that explains his arrival in England. Found on the platform of Paddington Station he is taken in by the friendly Mr and Mrs Brown and he soon becomes part of the family. 
 The adventures in this book are very different from those in darkest Peru and Paddington marvels at everything he sees. His innocent and almost naive nature are a delight, but he isn't so naive that he gets taken advantage of. He is a very well meaning bear and tries to do what is right, but I do love that he has a very persistent stare when he cares to use it, something that he brings out only for special occasions. 
 The book is a collection of the adventures Paddington has ranging from buying a coat (the coat) and going to the theatre or the beach. Reading how Bond explains these new experiences is a real joy, Paddington isn't a child and so his reactions are very logical and reasoned. He says what he sees and he tries to understand as best he can but is not shy from pointing out each and all of his issues. Having come from darkest Peru even the little things we do and take for granted are new, watching him take a bath or ride the escalator and lift are very amusing and the way he handles it is terribly sweet. 
 This is classed as a children's classic but I firmly believe this is a book that can be read and loved by everyone. Bond does not talk down to the reader as if he is writing for children, and despite there being two children in the book a lot of the conversation and content is directed at the adults, Paddington appears to have a much better relationship with the adults than the children. He is never once seen as a child but he is a young sort of bear which is different again entirely. 
 The 50th edition copy I have has a postscript by Bond explaining the impact Paddigton has had on himself and the world. he talks about where the idea came from and what it means to everyone. I do not think reading this changes the story in anyway, in a sense it is almost as if Paddington was sitting at the station, enjoying his life already and Bond simply wrote it down. As Garth Nix said, ""Often, I get the feeling that the story is really happening somewhere and all I'm doing is trying to work out the best way to tell it."" 
 Bond wrote this in 1958 so people have grown up with Paddington for years, and I just need to take one look at Winnie the Pooh to realise that growing older does not mean you do not have an affection for the stories you read as a child. Paddington is practically a national treasure, even Stephen Fry loves him and how can you not adore someone that even the darling Stephen Fry has the greatest respect for. 
 Please don't shy away from this book because you think it is for children, it can be read by children, adults and the elderly for eternity with equal love and affection. This is why it has become a timeless classic."

Largely because otherwise, the endless danger that Twig finds himself in seems pointless rather than another step on his heroic journey. The end is a little frustrating for me, considering the circumstances of how Twig came to be with the woodtrolls, but I'm hoping the later books will fix it in some way, or at least not cop out on the issues this could raise.

It's about a crow named Davey who finds, then loses, a shiny treasure he absolutely has to have. Deciding to emulate his favorite detective, Sherlock Holmes, and with the help of his very own Watson - a sparrow named Sarah - Davey sets out to solve the mystery of the missing treasure. 
 There's a really great moral to the story that I think will really resonate with younger kids. I like that about these books, and especially this one. 
 I was also quite fond of detective/mystery stories as a kid, myself. I loved reading Encyclopedia Brown books, as well as others. As an adult, I am a huge fan of the BBC's version of Sherlock with Benedict Cumberbatch. That's probably why this Bird Brain story is my favorite. 
 I highly recommend these books to parents to either read to their kids or let their kids read them on their own/to their parent. They're short, fun, and very easy to read. 
 I give Davey the Detective five wholesome stars!"

Much fretting over how to juggle reading the Shortlist with doing work, marking, planning ... and, this year, entertaining the baby! 
 And Roof Toppers was a lovely way to start the Shortlist ... Which I finished today by reading it out loud to the baby! Who says men can't multitask?! 
 The story follows Sophie, a year-old baby orphaned in a ship wreck in the English Channel and rescued by an English gentleman and gentle man by the name of Charles Maxim. It is set in an undefined period but with perhaps a nineteenth century feel: the authorities disapprove of a man raising a female child and, as she hits puberty, try to take her into care. To escape, Charles and Sophie flee to France in order to find Sophie's natural mother as - despite all the evidence to the contrary - Sophie is convinced survived the catastrophe. 
 Rundell has a lovely turn of phrase in the book: the prose has a musicality which is perhaps unsurprising when we realise that Sophie is saved inside a cello case in which is the first clue that sets her en route to Paris. It's the sort of book where I find myself underlining phrases such as 
 he had kindness where other people had lungs, and politeness in his fingertips. 
 In fact, Charles is a jolly good role model for a parent: unconventional, eccentric, scholarly to the point of archaic, he brought Sophie up on a diet of imagination, Shakespeare and music with large helpings of ice cream! 
 In fact, there are echoes of Shakespeare through the book. The eponymous roof toppers are a group of youths who inhabit the aerial spaces above Paris: the roof tops of buildings and tree tops of the parks. They are not far removed from the fairies of A Midsummer Nights Dream and Sophie's mother's photograph is discovered from the doomed vessel in which she was disguised as a man. Sophie also makes a copy of Hamlet ""slightly damp"" whilst using it as a booster seat and 
 had a habit of breaking plates, and so they had been eating their cake off the front cover of A Midsummer Night's Dream.... 
 Sophie ... waited until Charles was looking away, then dropped the book on the floor and did a handstand on it. 
 Charles laughed. 'Bravo!' He applauded against the table. 'You look the stuff that elves are made of.' 
 So, overall, and endearing and lovely book which is unlikely to win because it's too sweet"

There is so little detail when describing the world and the characters that I had a hard time connecting with anything at all in this book. There is definitely a Pollyanna feel to this world of OZ, and there are too many clear cut ""good"" and ""evil"" situations and characters. Nothing is clearly black and white in our world and it would have been nice to see the situation and characters fleshed out a little more to show the complexity that the real world clearly contains. I will always love L. Frank Baum for creating such a wonderful world of OZ, but I would have loved more from the original story in terms of plot and character complexity."

 Many fans of the series don't like this one, and I can see their complaints, especially if they paid a lot of money for it. It's the final book, but we only get three regular characters. Of course, it wasn't supposed to be the final book. Honey also develops a crush on someone we meet here. But looking past that, I see a decent mystery. It has flaws, but as a teen I didn't mind at all. Trixie and Honey are strong here, not their pod personalities. It certainly helps that I read it when I was about half way through reading the series originally and not as an adult who had paid a lot of get my hands on a copy.

 and on top of the glowing character(s), the language of the book is pure milky chocolate - just lovely and unexpected prose that really stands out when compared to any other book ever. this is a book i would have read until it fell apart if it had been around for me when i was, say, eight or so. this is a book you read when you are little and then take to college with you and then hand down to your own daughters. it is for sickbed reading, reading aloud, savoring and treasuring and pulling down from the shelves as needed. this book is begging to be inscribed and given as a gift. 
 there is nothing i don't like about this book. and there is no way i can do it justice. an extended quote is the best i have for you. 
 sophie is our young heroine, charles the man who took her in as a baby when she was found in the water after the capsizing of a boat, and miss eliot the social worker who disapproves of the whole situation. here: 
 Miss Eliot did not approve of Charles, nor of Sophie. She disliked Charles's carelessness with money, and his lateness at dinner. 
 She disliked Sophie's watching, listening face. ""It's not natural, in a little girl!"" She hated their joint habit of writing each other notes on the wallpaper in the hall. 
 ""It's not normal!"" she said, scribbling on her notepad. ""It's not healthy!"" 
 ""On the contrary,"" said Charles. ""The more words in a house the better, Miss Eliot."" 
 Miss Eliot also disliked Charles's hands, which were inky, and his hat, which was coming adrift round the brim. She disapproved of Sophie's clothes. 
 Charles was not good at shopping. He spent a day standing, bewildered, in the middle of Bond Street, and came back with a parcel of boys' shirts. Miss Eliot was livid. 
 ""You cannot let her wear that,"" she said. ""People will think she is deranged."" 
 Sophie looked down at herself. She fingered the material. It felt quite normal to her; still a little stiff from the shop, but otherwise fine. ""How can you tell it's not a girl's shirt?"" she asked. 
 ""Boys' shirts button left over right. Blouses - please note, the word is blouses - button right over left. I am shocked that you don't know that."" 
 Charles put down the newspaper behind which he had retreated. ""You are shocked that she doesn't know about buttons? Buttons are rarely key players in international affairs."" 
 ""I beg your pardon?"" 
 ""I meant, she knows the things which are important. Not all of them, of course; she is still a child. But many."" 
 Miss Eliot sniffed. ""You'll forgive me; I may be old-fashioned, but I think buttons do matter."" 
 ""Sophie,"" said Charles, ""knows all the capitals of all the countries of the world."" 
 Sophie, standing in the doorway, whispered, ""Almost."" 
 ""She knows how to read, and how to draw. She knows the difference between a tortoise and a turtle. She knows one tree from another, and how to climb them. Only this morning she was telling me what is the collective noun for toads."" 
 ""A knot,"" said Sophie. ""It's a knot of toads.""

 this book is so cute! 
 it is all about a little boy who cannot function without his stuffed monkey, bobo. i can totally relate - if i have to sleep without my bunny, i become very unhappy. i no longer carry him everywhere with me, as i did my entire freshman year of college (job interviews were fun, let me tell you!) earning me the nickname ""bunny girl,"" but i still have him and love him, and if my cat were to keep stealing him on me, like the cat in this book, there would be problems. oh - who am i kidding - i would think it was adorable. the boy in this book seems to have a problem with sharing bobo with his cat, earl, but i think i would be okay with it. maggie does not seem to like to snuggle with toys as much as i do. she is way more mature than her owner. 
 i love how bobo seems to make this kid bratty, ""BOBO DOESN'T LIKE RAISINS IN HIS OATMEAL!!"" ""BOBO THOUGHT WE WERE HAVING PANCAKES"", but bobo also protects him from scary dogs and buggas. and that is an admirable quality in stuffed pals. 
 the illustrations are very simple, but i love the frowny expression on earl's face whenever willy takes bobo back. earl will have his vengeance. adorable. 
 i particularly love that when i typed in the title to review this, goodreads politely asked me, ""did you mean i must have boob??"" goodreads, have you been reading my mail?? 
 when you click the link for ""i must have boob,"" however, it takes you exactly nowhere. way to prank me, goodreads..."

 REVIEW BY: Angel, age 13 years, 4 months 
 MAY CONTAIN SPOILER: 
 This book was a slow-paced book filled with tons of mystery and questions unanswered to keep you on the edge of your seat! This novel was fun to read and I loved how it wasn't really a Christmas story, but that it involved the North Pole and the South Pole. Also that it involved the mysterious armies and enemies ran by the evil Jack Frost. I just loved this book for those reasons! 
 This book is about an elf named Flea. At first in this story Flea doesn't know that he is an elf, but he knows how to build anything and everything extremely well! Flea also finds out that he is great with snow. His shop teacher, Mr. Strick, gets him on the show, The Great Build-Off, but Flea's foster mom won't allow him to go on it because of unknown reasons to keep him hidden from bad people! However, Flea goes to the show anyway. After the show, some one gives him a gold ring and at 11:59 p.m. on Christmas Eve he puts the ring on and ends up in the North Pole. At the North Pole, he makes friends, learns tons of secrets and learns that he is a danger to Christmas and the North Pole. He also finds out that he is possibly related to Santa Clause!"

a18eddac122b5fcdd8b7c1a79efb53c4,1496341,d59a4055cef2cbf96e75423db4cd575c,3,"I don't know that I've seen the Disney film based on this book. I've seen bits and pieces at the very least, but if I've seen it all, I hardly remember it. I only read this because my wife and I were talking about it and I decided that it was a shame I hadn't read the book. I was more in the mood for an adult story though, so I rushed through it. Not that it takes a while to get through. It is certainly written for children, even if there are aspects of the story that become quite dark. Apparently, Collodi intended on the book ending when Pinocchio was hanged, but his publisher asked for more. Frankly, I found the moralization to be heavy-handed and any child worth his salt would agree I'm sure. But the disturbing aspects of the book were its redeeming quality: the blue fairy, when she first appears, is the ghost of a young girl, waiting for the bier to carry her off; the killing of the Talking Cricket with a hammer; the death of Candlewick; and the entire dog-fish story line. Of course, with any translation, judging the writing style is difficult. One isn't really judging the author so much as the translator, and since I don't speak or read Italian, I'll reserve my judgements of the writing for myself. Obviously, this book is a classic. It has lasted over an hundred years and has been beloved by children the entirety of that time. As an adult though, I found it tiring for the most part. I just wanted to get through it. I would read it to my children, but it wouldn't be my first choice. I'd reach for Alice, The Hobbit, or the Narnia stories long before I came to this work."

Now that I have a son and daughter of my own, it is awesome to be able to re-read stories like this with them. Brings back great memories. I bought this book for my son about two weeks ago at our local Walmart. Most of the books he has at home were given to me by my sister, that had belonged to my nephew (who is now 14.) And most of the books are longer books that don't keep a two year old s attention. After realizing he had very few short picture books to get started with, we have been picking one new one up every month. Last month we got him The Very Hunger Caterpillar. He is slowly starting to love reading and that makes me one very happy momma. This book in particular I really love because it's not only fun for him to listen to, but it is also helping him identify colors and animals. He can properly tell me all of the animals in the book. Before the book he didn't know what a sheep was, and he didn't know the word 'teacher' either, now he knows both! At the end when the children are saying what they see, my son and I go through and I point to each animal and he tells me what it is. Next we are going to work on adding the colors. Instead of ""birdy"" I am going to try to get him to say ""RED birdy"" 
 Helping my little guy learn is fun! :-)"

 I didn't get it. Oh, I got to see her home and photos of Enid at work and in her garden, but I came away from the book feeling as though I'd been patronised and steered away from the real Enid, the Enid that successfully functioned in a world not made for women with careers.

 I may seem somewhat bias on this review because I grew up with Dr.Seuss but, I found this book to be really entertaining and eye opening. It starts out with a perfect environment populated by animals and trees that are called truffula's. Than the story takes a dramatic turn when someone called the ""Once-ler"" he sees the truffula trees as a benefit and profit which leads to the anti-climatic end and new hope. I won't spoil much more of the story except that the lorax is the only one to stay to the very end and fight for the need of the trees. So, please read for a story with a message and humor of the original seuss."

The book began and ended somewhat abruptly. The dinosaurs aren't too scary, even the velocirpator. The title takes its name from a scene in which the boys fish for the velociraptor, trying to lure him out of his cave with bacon, so that they can retrieve a small computer device called a fossil finder. It's funny that the boys slipping into a world of dinosaurs didn't mess with my sense of implausibility, but this scene did. This series should appeal to beginning chapter book readers who love dinosaurs and adventures, but they should definately begin with the first book."

I belong to the ""third party"" who thinks he was both. It's widely known that drugs, especially cocaine and opium, were considered a kind of medicine during Victorian Age. Having said that, we must admit that drugs need a great deal of writing abilities to create such an entertaining universe and such awesome characters: yeah, you guys I'm talking about the Cheshire Cat and yes, I'm talking about The Caterpillar that are probably the characters that express the satire and the most philosophical content of the story. 
 What struck me the most though, was Carroll's fondness for plays on words and puns that often disguise a a deeper and wittier meaning. 
 I love it when books can be read in different levels and when despite the number of times you've read them you still find new meanings every single time."

But I disagree. As authors like Mo Willems and Ian Falconer have shown us, adults, and indeed people of all ages, should be able to delight in the words and visuals of such books. However, this is not an example. The illustrations are just OK and the story truly dull. The cat Earl keeps stealing Bobo, the main character's beloved sock monkey. That's basically it. The characters and writing don't stand out at all, and there is hardly much content to judge. Not a winner."

This book continues the exploits of Robert and his friends Glen and Karina as they fight against the evil Crawford Tillinghast and his host of creatures who are attempting to take over Lovecraft Middle School. 
 In each of the previous installments, Richard and his friends face new and terrifying creatures, and this book is no exception with the arrival of the Old Ones. I do wish, however, that the title character, Miss Carcasse the substitute teacher, would have played a more central role in the story. 
 Most of the story takes place on the grounds of the school when the children, Robert's mother, Miss Carcasse, and the school's caretaker are all trapped do to a monstrous blizzard. Until help can arrive they have to find a way to stay warm when the power cuts out. Freezing, however, is the least of their worries. The Old Ones are trying to break into the school, and although the grown ups are blissfully unaware of this danger, Richard knows of the horrors that lurk within the school and the secret passages that lead back to Tillinghast manor.

This is a funny introduction to the world of mythological creatures as the main character considers how these creatures might make better pets than her hamster who for the most part sleeps. I would love to share this book with the likes of Sparky by Jenny Offill and other stories that have dissatisfied pet owners as main characters. The exagerated features of the mythical creatures and the little girl's square glasses and cartoonish expressions will have readers reaching for paper and pencil to create similar lovable characters."

 It was a concerto that led me through the wonderful life of Sophie and Charles. Oh, how I loved them. I loved all the main characters. The way they were written was captivating to me in a way I did not know before. The story was wild and improbable but I enjoyed every second. The cello is an instrument I admire greatly, and its inclusion in the story only made me enjoy the story even more. 
 The idea of ""Rooftoppers"" was fascinating, and I enjoyed learning about these children hidden in plain sight, living day to day. The story was so wholesome. Charles was a supporting father. The ""Rooftoppers"" decided to help Sophie with little time knowing her. Sophie, she just believed and loved so freely and beautifully. 
 Rooftoppers was not one of those books that had delicate phrases or scenes that brought tears to your eyes, but it's style and charms brought me love regardless."

I never mind reading a child's book with with good tempo, rhyme, and a plot that invites alternative reading paces and voices. In my adult life I look at children's books as performance pieces, helping build the bond between me and my son. How the Grinch Stole Christmas! is excellent. It allows us to discuss the meaning of Christmas and some of the entrapments in society and human nature. It lets me read orally in a way that builds skill in speaking and challenges me if I try to vary voices and tempo. It's a fun book, and if the oral reader has fun, so does the listener. The Grinch is lovable in his lesson and the Who's noble in their resilience."

 Most twelve-year-olds don't spend their summers working fourteen hours at their grandmother's Bed and Breakfast which caters to aliens, yet that is exactly what David (nicknamed Scrub) does in this story. Floridian Scrub is spending the summer at his peace loving, granola crunching health nut Grandma's Intergalactic Bed and Breakfast located in the Pacific Northwest of Washington. Both the humans in Grandma's hometown and the aliens are unlike any Scrub has ever met. There's Mr. Hoarax who can play a mean game of basketball, Sheriff Tate who wants to close the place down, his daughter Amy who has an interest in all things extraterrestrial and an interest in Scrub, plus Zardolph and his younger brothers who are able to float on water and gather firewood like it's no else's business. 
 Can David survive his summer in the Pacific Northwest? Will Grandma be able to keep her Bed and Breakfast open past the summer or is it time for her to retire? What about Sheriff Tate, will he succeed in his plans to close down the place? And what about Amy, can she be friends with David or not? Find out the answers to these questions and more in this book."

Action that keeps you on the edge of your seat and the sibling bond is lovely. Flawless writing. And I love that it's set in a place that I now know so well, don't get that very often! (I have to say this is a bit of a niche book though - an essential read for kiwi kids but I think if I was reading it for the first time as an adult the lack of nostalgia for it would bump it down a bit, and if you're not from NZ you might not ""get"" it so much, but in saying that it's only the places that are referenced, otherwise it's not too specific to NZ)."

I am just not that interested in the rest of the story. I believe the initial story and concept were interesting, but even though I don't necessarily think anything should be ""cut out"" I still felt that, for what it was, the book was too long. I also felt like Kate was a bit dynamic, and Michael more so, but Emma - she was so static it hurt. Even though she developed a relationship with Gabriel, I just felt like she really didn't change from beginning to end. Overall, not a bad book, but not a great one either. Just good."

How she fell down the rabbit hole and had lots of adventures with strange characters. The movies don't really do the book justice, but the audio version I listened to was wonderful. It was a BBC Radio production with lots of characters and added sound effects. I hadn't realized just how political or satirical the story was. It is a wonderfully fun read with lots of interesting words and scenes. I loved the Mock Turtle and the Caucus Race. I thought the Queen of Hearts was magnificent. Even though it is 150 years old it really didn't have the out-of-date feel that some books of that age do.

Then she starts receiving letters from Grammy Claire. The letters point to a mystery that has to be solved about the nipwisipwis (butterflies). Grammy Claire's study of the butterflies had taken her from her home in Louisiana to an island in the Pacific. Tara and her sister Riley are taken in by Claire's butler Reginald and whisked away first to her Louisiana home in the swamp and then to her tree house on the island. Tara continues to receive letters and clues and mysteries keys from Grammy Claire. She has to solve the clues, figure out what the keys open and find out who is trying to endanger the nipwisipwis. 
 This is a fabulous mystery for kids. I think they will really enjoy following the clues along with Tara. I loved the relationship between Tara and Riley. Even though it is prickly it is still very sisterly and they do truly care for each other. I did find it a little strange that the girls just went off with Claire's butler leaving their mother at home suffering from melancholy. I liked the fact that we are left guessing a little bit about the true power of the nipwisipwis. It made it a little more believable. There are many mysterious plants and animals in the world so who knows if butterflies could really have restorative properties."

I am sure I could have done better if I had really tried, but I was really more interested in the story. And the story did suck me. I liked the quest the students had to go on to solve all the puzzles. I think there is something to be said for a book that showcases smart, clever kids doing what they do best. Sure they made mistakes and weren't always right the first time, but they persevered and they helped each other. Basically they were good role models for kids reading the book. I liked the fact that the characters weren't all nerdy puzzle-solving geeks...there was a nice mix of kids, which illustrated that everyone can be smart and clever in their own way. 
 I also thought there was a good discussion in the book on cheating and what exactly constitutes cheating. Were some instances cheating, were they just good game strategy, were they mean and sneaky but not cheating? All good questions for kids to ponder. I thought it was interesting that the author made the kids more honest than the adults. I find that kids are often more honest so I thought this was probably pretty true to life and a good lesson. I liked how this moral/thought provoking plot was woven throughout the story. It wasn't really in-your-face but it was there for you to think about. 
 The story itself was good. It was a nice pace; it kept the tension and attention going. The puzzles were nice but you really didn't have to solve them to enjoy the story. There were a lot of characters and it was sometimes hard to keep them all separate. If I really have one complaint it is that I didn't think the villain was that developed. We didn't have a lot of backstory or reasoning until the very end so it seemed to come from nowhere. But I liked the resolution of the story. Everything turned out the way it should be. 
 A good book and one I think the kids will enjoy."

 I'm a big fan of the crayons books! I was so excited when I saw this book coming out about the crayons and their adventures with numbers (there is also one for colors). This book is great for young, emergent readers or children just beginning their math studies. The focus of this book is on counting and it is presented in a very simple manner. 
 This book is great for young children to develop a basic understanding of counting and to begin to understand the importance of math in their lives. This book is simple, but powerful."

 Sam just got a hamster for a pet. But the hamster is kind of boring ... he just eats and sleeps and gets his shavings wet. Inspired by her book of mythological creatures, Sam longs for a more exciting pet. But she soon realizes that taking care of these magical beasts might not be as wonderful as she thought. Sasquatches are messy, unicorns are shy, gryphons scare the dogs at the dogpark, and having a fire extinguisher handy at all times makes dragons seem like an awful lot of work. In the end, Sam realizes that her hamster is a pretty sweet and safe pet ... or is he? 
 If I Had a Gryphon is a raucous rhyming read-aloud about fantastical beasts in everyday situations--and the increasingly beleaguered heroine who has to deal with them. 
 Poor Sam - not happy with having a hamster for a pet, she dreams about having a pile of mythological animals as pets instead. Then, reality sets in and the problems of raising a Gryphon (or a dragon, a Sasquatch or unicorn) becomes clear. 
 I did enjoy this book - there were enough mythological creatures to make me happy. I found the rhyming text to be incredibly fun and engaging. The illustrations were definitely the highlight of the book for me. 
 A great present for the child in your life with an active imagination. Highly recommended.

 Tara's grandmother dies in a car accident which sets the whole story into motion. Her father has left and her mother has checked out. Tara and her older sister Riley have a typical sibling relationship meaning they are just mean to each other. The first butterfly visits on the afternoon of the funeral and the Grammy Claire's butler/lawyer/friend shows up with a letter filled with clues and unanswered questions and whisks Tara and Riley off to her house on the bayou of Louisiana. Soon the clues lead them to the island of Chuuk where Tara must solve the mystery and save the butterflies. 
 I gave this a 3 because the ending just left too many plot holes that I as an adult couldn't ignore. 
 Good points 
 Well-written, engaging story 
 Clues were marvelous and the main reason I kept reading 
 Information about the butterflies was marvelous 
 Loved the butterflies 
 Bad points (Spoiler Alert) 
 Tara and Riley were not very likable at the beginning, just too mean to each other. 
 Ending 
 What king of grandmother who, when her life is in danger and fears that she will be killed sets up an elaborate ploy with albeit wonderful clues that places her granddaughters in danger and then watches from afar. And then tells Tara that she can implicitly trust the one person who she shouldn't trust. The events that lead to the climax were not well thought out. The plot needed most foreshadowing so it would all come together reasonably."

When young Molly finds out her next door neighbour Maureen has been taken to hospital, she worries about Murray being on his own and left to fend for himself. She decides to make him a curry. One page gives the list of ingredients she used. From then on, Molly becomes known as the one to help others in the neighbourhood out with a special dish. As word spreads, Molly ends up making meals for people from further away. Each dish gives the easy to follow ingredients, so budding cooks might see what is needed to make it. 
 The book shows a variety of different people, some from other countries and a variety of foods. All are simply and colourfully illustrated. Even the local police are recipients of Molly's cooking skills. The rhymes make this a fun story to read. But it is more than just a fun story with great illustrations. It is a story with heart. I could see this being useful in schools and preschools opening up discussion about foods from other countries certainly, but also about being good neighbours and helping others. 
 Then comes the day Molly cannot cook, because she has hurt herself. What will happen? While the ending is cute, I would have liked to see a little different ending and a bit more effort from the neighbours rather than the obvious, but maybe that is just me. That small quibble aside this is a fun book with a great message that is not preachy but simply part of the story. I really liked the interaction between young and old and people from different backgrounds. This book deserves to find a home in many libraries and schools."

This was a quick read that had lots of great activity pages throughout to keep young readers engaged in the book and the topic. In today's society, where expectations on how to look, dress, act, etc. are learned at a ridiculously young age, this book takes the topic head on. It tries to teach children that being different in any way is cool - not lame. Not only is it cool to be different - other kids are cool for being different in their own ways too. The book touches on deep topics like self esteem, bullying, and societal norms in a way that kids will understand and even enjoy learning about. It's sad that our culture has come to this point - where young children have to be taught that it's alright to be different from others - whether it's skin color, weight, height, wearing glasses, etc., that these characteristics make some people unique and special - that they are nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed about. The author and illustrator make this a great learning tool by integrating fun activities along with the narrative and the entire book is full of bright and colorful illustrations. I definitely recommend this book to parents of children who are beginning school or are in lower elementary grades. Also, this would be a fantastic book for teachers and counselors to use in order to talk about bullying and being different.

The book is a children's book and is relatively short with pictures on each page. The illustrations themselves are done in black, white, and red and appear to be drawn with pencil or ink. They aren't overly detailed or brightly colored, but they are interesting to look at because the characters of the Grinch and the Whos, as well as their village are so fantastically different from anything in the real world. 
 The story itself is written in prose, with several poem qualities. The rhyme scheme used definitely appeals to the reader (or listener) as the endings of each line couplet rhyme to give it a sing-song rhythm. Smaller children who are listening to the story being read to them will like this rhyming and it will keep their attention. Another interesting thing to note about the writing is the use of completely nonsensical and made up words. Dr. Seuss is a master of this kind of language and is famous for using it in his books. The words he invented for the story are unusual and are sure to stick in the minds of the readers. The plot is a fun one, but also has a great moral to it as well. The story is teaching children that the true meaning of Christmas doesn't come from gifts or things that are bought, but from love and being together. Overall, this is a Christmas classic that readers of all ages will enjoy. It's a true classic that never gets old and one that will be appreciated for years to come.

We listened to this (all 4+ hours of it) multiple times while driving all over the UK countryside over two weeks, having purchased it at the Roald Dahl Museum. I thought that Avery (aged 4) would lose interest in it after a little while, but he was enraptured from the minute it started, and would frequently refuse to leave the car because he didn't want to stop the story. Walliams reading is magic. He brings the book to life without hamming it up, capturing the beautiful rhythms of the BFG's idiosyncratic speech, and Dahl's own invented words."

When she was a girl, Katy was shuffled around from one foster home to another. There was never the opportunity to make friends. Other children tormented her, teased her, and bullied her. Then she connected with Sandra and her friends. Sandra was into the show-jumping circuit. So was her closest friend, Babs. Sandra and Babs accepted Katy as their friend and soon the rest of their group accepted Katy as well. 
 Things were not quite so rosy, though, even with Sandra's friendship. The other children still bullied Katy. She was always running away. Even now, she frequently has nightmares of running from trouble. She would shudder out of her nightmares, stomp her feet, shuffle restlessly and wake up her stable mate, Tommy. You see, Katy is now a horse. Some twist of fate as she ran from her last bit of trouble mysteriously turned her into a horse. 
 It seems almost fanciful. Indeed, it's unbelievable, but there is a message in this story and it's a well thought out plot that captures the reader right from the start. It is a story worth the telling. 
 You see, trouble seems to continually follow Katy, who is now Lady, the horse. She can communicate with other horses, and, using a marker grasped between her teeth, she can communicate in short word phrases with her friends, Sandra and the rest of the group. Lady senses things that her human friends can't sense. She understands that there are some horses in trouble - a lot of horses in trouble. These horses are being shuffled around from stable to stable, just like Katy as a girl was shuffled around from foster home to foster home. The horses are abused, maltreated and bullied, just like Katy had been as a girl. Katy, or Lady, wants to help these horses. So do her human friends. This is where the adventure begins. 
 Elizabeth Sellers is a dedicated horse lover. This is evident in her writing. Her first book, If Horses Were Wishes, tells Katy's story when she was a foster child, running from trouble until she was mysterious turned into a horse. Trouble Rides a Fast Horse is its sequel and there's another book in the series in the works. When she's not writing about horses, the author rides and teaches riding. 
 Trouble Rides a Fast Horse is a fast-paced, action-filled story that would appeal to young readers. It has a simple, but exciting story, with a strong message that needs to be shared over and over again. Katy the girl was bullied. She escaped the bullying when she was turned into a horse. Only, as a horse, she witnesses another form of abuse: animal abuse. Young people need to respect not only each other, but animals, too. 
 The author provides a compelling plot, even if the fantastical idea of a girl turning into a horse seems unbelievable. That's what makes stories interesting to young people - the fantasy element. The characters are certainly believable and the issue of human and animal abuse and bullying is something that needs to be brought out into the open so that young people can learn to respect others and grow up to be adults who respect others. It's not just young people who bully, as the reader discovers in the mean characters of Mr. Chance and his employees. The message in this novel is clear and very well presented. 
 Trouble Rides a Fast Horse is highly recommended by Emily-Jane Hills Orford, award-winning author of The Whistling Bishop and F-Stop: A Life in Pictures."

The lessons are so simple and yet so subtle here - and it is great on so many different levels. The Thneed question makes me almost blush because I have so many thneeds (iPhone, iPad, Mac, Cinema Display, PS3, etc). Who else would have thought of such a perfect word like thneeds. Or sluppity slupp and gloopity gloop. Tonight my son wanted me to show him a Whisper-ma-phone and to hear a snargley voice. What can I say?

I can see why it won awards while the two sequels did not. Only ever referring to the main character as ""my father"" leant a perfect note to the cozy story. I missed that element when the other two books started calling him Elmer. I also thought the plot of the first book (such as it was) was more distinguished as well. While it is very episodic in nature, it certainly achieves what it sets out to do. There is a classic flow to the book as Elmer is given a series of challenges which he overcomes one at a time using the eclectic supplies he originally packed. By contrast, the next two books seem a bit drab, as though reaching for a plot instead of just wandering through a magical world. I also liked that the numbers were always very particular. It's never a bunch of alligators or a nice round number like ten, it's always seventeen alligators or something like that. 
 That being said, however, I am not entirely sure that this book would have made it to my top list if I had been on the Newbery committee. Perhaps that it simply because its impact was watered down when I read all three books at once, and the second two books were not as good. It may also be that I am far more used to Newbery books leaning towards the older side of the crowd, and so don't have as much reference to what is most distinguished in books for younger children."

Cam got her nickname because of her photographic memory. All she has to do is say ""Click,"" and Cam can remember everything she's seen, which comes in pretty handy when trying to solve mysteries. 
 David Adler has written several beginning chapter book series, but Cam Jansen is one of the earliest and most successful. He's been writing the series since 1980 and now writes roughly one volume per year. He has also started a Young Cam Jansen series of even simpler chapter books. Reading level wise, I'd say children they'd interest children from kindergarden through fifth grade who are just starting to read chapter books. I didn't read any of the the young Cam Jansen books, but it looks like they're more limited in scope and probably would be considered ""baby books"" to anyone beyond 2nd grade. 
 Because the books are so short, I read essentially the first half of the series and the 25th anniversary special ""The Valentine Day Baby Mystery"" where Cam's mom has twins, ending Cam's only child status, and Eric's mom has her car stolen, only to be returned when Cam's quick thinking discovers the thief. 
 Overall I was surprised at how engaging these stories were. I would totally recommend them to children just starting to read chapter books. The print is big and there are still several black and white drawings scattered throughout the text, making them an easy transition from picture books. Plus, they're well-written enough that I think they can nudge children to move on to better quality titles as they move on to longer chapter books. 
 Of course they're not perfect, though. It seems that adults Cam and Eric interact with choose to not accept Cam's photographic memory only when it's necessary to create tension in the story. Otherwise most adults take for granted that this 10-year-old can solve diamond thefts and bank robberies. Still, it has to be empowering for kids to read about someone close to their age solving mysteries like that. 
 I was also kind of bothered by the way Cam always ends up being right. Sometimes she comes off as a little too cocky and unwilling to listen to others. In nearly every story Eric plays the wet blanket suggesting that they tell an adult what they've discovered rather than trying to catch the bad guy on their own. However Cam always forges ahead and ends up getting her suspect. Again, I'm sure kids love the feeling of accomplishment, but sometimes it feels like Cam's walking the fine line between extreme confidence and recklessness, as in the Chocolate Fudge Mystery where she trespasses into someone's back yard just because she thinks it's weird that no one's home. Her dad and Eric both tell her she shouldn't be doing this, but Cam doesn't care because she's certain there's a mystery to be solved. She turns out be right (there's a bank robber hiding in the house) and her disregard for strangers' privacy is forgotten. 
 And honestly, that's the problem I had with these books when I was little. While it was cool to read about a kid doing cool stuff like solving robberies, I could always tell that the stories weren't quite true to real life. I guess that's why I always preferred stories of kids doing amazing things that were based off real stories like Island of the Blue Dolphins or at least seemed more realistic. 
 My husband, however, loved these books as a kid and said he read every one he could get his hands on when he was younger, so I guess that's at least some proof of their appeal to both sexes. Both libraries I checked these books out from had multiple copies of the titles in this series and even then I had trouble finding all the titles actually on the shelf, so they continue to be popular titles. I think they would be great additions to a school or public library collection."

We lost our first two babies to miscarriage and are now pregnant with our third. I borrowed this book from the library and we read it to this little one one night before bed. My husband immediately wanted to go out and buy it. It is an awesome book with a message that we had always wanted our kids to hear, especially after what we have been through. That they are SPECIAL. each and every one of them. that no matter what people say about them, that God made them and what He thinks is all that matters. That when others put them down, or tell them they can't do anything, they can think 'I am special'. But even more importantly, this book also makes you think not just of how you are viewed as special.. but of how you make others feel. it teaches not just kids, but adults, to really think 'am i making my friends, family, and coworkers feel special? or am i covering them with dots' 
 This book isn't just for kids. its for us adults as well :) when you read it to kids, take the message for yourself. 
 We lead by example, so if we do not view ourselves as special, why will our children?"

 The story is quite repetitive but without being too dull. This makes it perfect for young children to join in with and edit/adapt to make it their own. 
 What I liked about this book was that I could instantly see how I could use it in class. It focuses on windy weather conditions and specifically on playing games in the wind. Instantly I could see lessons based around science (materials/habitats), maths (measurements/seasons/shape/counting), art/D&T (sketches, collages or even making our own kites!), story writing (TFW), and just about everything in between. Given the bright and lovely images throughout, this could make for some lovely displays too, now we're really into teacher geekiness! 
 All in all, a solid 4 star book which could easily be adapted and used for Early Years or right the way through KS1."

 I read it to my kids at bedtime, and while they both enjoyed it, I found that my seven year old got much more out of it than my five year old. They got out their plastic tea set and had a tea party every night while I read it to them. 
 While Paddington proves to be a humorous and delightful tale for children, the pace is often slow and the comprehension level is for kids a little older than mine are. They had a great time laughing at Paddington's antics, however. They especially liked the beginning when the Browns first find Paddington, his attempt at taking a bath, and his birthday party when he does a bunch of disappearing tricks. 
 For my part, I found it charming. I've always loved classic stories and this was no exception. I think kids that are a little older will appreciate it more (age 9+), but it's a great addition to any child's library.

 This book wasn't nearly as creepy as I had expected it to be, but it is intended for kids, so I can't really complain about that.

 The messages contained in the book are plentiful and easily identified. Beauty is what your heart looks like, not your outward appearance. Dishonesty leads to disaster. Kindness breeds kindness, and the list goes on. 
 The voice of the author, the subject matter of the book, and the fable-like plot all lend themselves to the old fashioned atmosphere in the story. It almost felt as if I had picked up one of my old Peter Rabbit or Old Mother Westwind books. 
 This is an independently published work, and I feel like that fact was fairly obvious as I read. It is well written, and there are no spelling or grammar mistakes that I can think of (applause!). However, there are parts of the story that come off as unpolished or unrealistic. It could have really used some illustrations, too. 
 Overall, it was a nice story with a good moral. There is quite a bit of action and strong language (no cursing, just insults and condescending remarks) used throughout the story, so it would probably be suitable for children 6 and up.

They go in search of real children on Halloween night. Morgan doesn't believe that children are real, and Bela wants to prove that they are.

 While this isn't my favorite Halloween book, it is a cute read and children will enjoy it. It was a book that I didn't really love, but didn't hate.

 My Review: Hiding behind Mike Mulligan and his Steam Shovel is hiding this little gem of a book. I had never even heard of this book until browsing amazon. I absolutely adore this book, it is a great story with fantastic illustrations. There are so many elements to this book and everything combined together makes it a great classic story to share with children of all ages. I know Munchkin sure enjoyed it."

No one quite knows the reason."" Dr. Seuss's small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest, scowling holiday grumps of all time. For 53 years, the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain, looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His ""wonderful, awful"" idea is to don a Santa outfit, strap heavy antlers on his poor, quivering dog Max, construct a makeshift sleigh, head down to Whoville, and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all. 
 Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up, the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos' presents, their food, even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle sleigh to Mt. Crumpit to dump it and waits to hear the sobs of the Whos when they wake up and discover the trappings of Christmas have disappeared. Imagine the Whos' dismay when they discover the evil-doings of Grinch in his anti-Santa guise. But what is that sound? It's not sobbing, but singing! Children simultaneously adore and fear this triumphant, twisted Seussian testimonial to the undaunted cheerfulness of the Whos, the transcendent nature of joy, and of course, the growth potential of a heart that's two sizes too small. This holiday classic is perfect for reading aloud to your favorite little Whos."" 
 My Review: Such a classic, you didn't think I would forget to read it for Christmas did you?! This story has such a great message, that its not about the decorations, gifts or any of that stuff; the holidays are about love and those around us. Of all Dr. Seuss' books, this one doesn't seem as hard to read aloud, not too many made up words or tongue twisters. It was a little advanced from Munchkin but he still enjoyed the cadence and the illustrations."

 Anyway, it's an adventure with magic and cats and the main character, Mary, is clever and brave. I'd say it's a perfect kind of children's book. And because it was fun to read as adult too, even more so it's a good book. I really liked Mary, she's young but not bratty. Also: the book gets bonus points for cats! The text is quick to read but also has lovely descriptions. The book is short but it's paced very well so it doesn't feel rushed. 
 Only lacking thing is the motivation of the antagonists, it's never told why they exactly did what they did. Even if it's a children's adventure story, some kind of reason beyond ""being evil"" would've been nice."

I say this as I didn't find the 'bad guys' at all frightening, and I felt the suspense is always underlined by the safety net that you just know everything will be ok in the end. Still, A whisper of wolves made for a quick, light read and I will definitely be reading the next book in the series. 
 Alice is an apprentice whisperer. Never knowing her parents, she was chosen at birth by the white raven, and gifted with the magical ability to connect with the earth and communicate with her animal companion, a wolf named storm. But around her small village a sickness is spreading through the forrest, signs that an ancient evil is returning to the world. 
 Meanwhile on the other side of the kingdom, Dawn has just finished her apprenticeship, and with the passing of her teacher, has graduated into a full fledged whisperer who is now in charge of protecting the palace, and its royal residents. But because of her young age, she is met with opposition from the kings officials. No one will believe her that evil has returned to the kingdom and so she and her raven companion, Ebony, must strike out on their own to save the palace before its too late. 
 As both girls battle to save their homes, they fight to be believed by their elders, all whilst training to attain the highest ability of a whisperer, the power to banish demons... 
 I quite enjoyed this story. Both heroines have strong personalities and aren't afraid to break the rules over what they know to be right vs what people believe is right. Their animal companions seem to act older, and often offer wisdom to their human friends, but I must admit I thought having a wolf and a raven was a little cliche. 
 Also while I thought the writing itself, along with the descriptions were pretty good, the plot - while action based - seemed to lack a little something. As I mentioned earlier, I felt tasks were achieved a little too easily so higher-level readers may find themselves a little restless with this story. 
 However the book was sweet in its simplicity. The bad guys, the whisperers powers and the location of the girls were all explained in an easy to follow manner. This would be a good MG book for younger readers wanting something a little more challenging, but keeping with the 'nothing bad will happen' plot lines of younger books. Not once did I ever feel the characters were in real peril! 
 So overall a nice, short read that I think will really capture the imagination of a younger reader. Sweet stuff! 3 stars!"

He loved the idea of being free like Molly, on an adventure without grown-ups. Molly takes a trip on a magical night train and experiences a night circus. Both locations are full of mystery and amazing description of foods, smells and circus tents. The experience was mysterious but not foreboding. I, as a mother, was happy that Molly's dad had a handle on the situation, but he didn't spoil the fun. 
 While this is a middle grade book, there are some advanced themes - dealing with the death of a parent and a grandpa who spent time in prison. It kept us guessing while Molly went on her adventure, what would happen to these heavier issues she was dealing with, and were pleased they were addressed in a positive way that my son understood and related to."

Unfortunately since he's an owl most of the other birds and insects are afraid of him! What's Owly to do? And then...one day he rescues a worm, Wormy, from a rain storm, nurses him back to health, and then offers to help him get back home to his parents. Owly carefully guards the young Wormy on their journey back to his home and his parents. In the second story Owly and Wormy once again team up to rescue and care for two young hummingbirds and the group soon becomes fast friends. But winter is coming and the hummingbirds can't survive for long in the cold. Owly and Wormy learn that sometimes being good friends, means saying goodbye for a while. 
 Owly is one of those deceptively simple books that has something for everyone. It's a complete wordless tale that relies on the reader to look closely at the illustrations to decipher the story being told. And what powerful stories they are. Although Andy is illustrating age old concepts (saying goodbye doesn't mean forever and don't judge by appearances) he puts a fresh twist on them that makes them enjoyable for all ages. You can't help but feel sad for Owly as he tries to make a friend, and rejoice when he's able to team up with Wormy. The illustrations are extremely important since there are no words and Andy does a masterful job of creating characters that are memorable, easy to identify, and enjoyable. The illustration are light, simple, and carefree and work well with the story. It's easy to figure out the characters expressions and know instantly how they're feeling. My one wish is that there would be more color to the illustrations, like on the front cover, but its a minor wish. 
 I look forward to future adventures of Owly, Wormy and friends and highly recommend this story to everyone."

 Premise/plot: Duck, Duck, Porcupine is the first book in a new early reader series starring Big Duck, Little Duck, and Porcupine. There are three short adventures in this one. The first is ""A Perfect Day for a Picnic."" Little Duck is the first to notice that it will soon be RAINING. But will a little rain--or a lot of rain--spoil the day completely? It may not be a perfect day to EAT outside, but, it may be a perfect day to PLAY outside. The second is ""I Think I Forgot Something."" Big Duck is CLUELESS. Little Duck tries to help Big Duck remember what she forgot. (Holding up a present, holding up a birthday invite, bringing out a calendar, etc.) Will she remember in time that it is Porcupine's birthday?! The third is ""The Campout.""

929bfe22df70aacffe15fa2478d96177,28875,ba04d927cd07bc1bd1e17bdea79eb682,4,"I really enjoyed reading My Father's Dragon (1948), Elmer And the Dragon (1950), and The Dragons of Blueland (1951), all by Ruth Stiles Gannett. (My Father's Dragon was a Newbery Honor book for 1949.) I'd read My Father's Dragon before many years ago--long before I started blogging--but this was my first opportunity, I believe, to read the two sequels. 
 I loved the way My Father's Dragon opens: 
 One cold rainy day when my father was a little boy, he met an old alley cat on his street. The cat was very drippy and uncomfortable so my father said, ""Wouldn't you like to come home with me?"" This surprised the cat--she had never before met anyone who cared about old alley cats--but she said, ""I'd be very much obliged if I could sit by a warm furnace, and perhaps have a saucer of milk."" ""We have a very nice furnace to sit by, said my father, ""and I'm sure my mother has an extra saucer of milk."" My father and the cat became good friends but my father's mother was very upset about the cat. She hated cats, particularly ugly old alley cats. ""Elmer Elevator,"" she said to my father, ""if you think I'm going to give that cat a saucer of milk, you're very wrong. Once you start feeding stray alley cats you might as well expect to feed every stray in town, and I am not going to do it!"" 
 This opening hooked me. It is through the cat--his cat--that he learns of a baby dragon in desperate need of help. He tells of the Island of Tangerina and Wild Island. He learns about the captive dragon and the dangerous residents of the island. He is determined to help free the dragon. The cat helps him form a plan... 
 The first book is all about his going to the islands, his adventures and misadventures as he's looking for the dragon--it's a good thing he came to the island well-prepared! Does he find the dragon? You can guess the answer to that. Of course he does! 
 My Father's Dragon is a delightful fantasy book for very young readers. It's short and quite satisfying. 
 In Elmer and the Dragon, Elmer starts his journey home--by dragon. His new dragon friend will fly him home. But neither Elmer or the dragon know the way home precisely. Elmer ends up having just as many adventures returning home as he did running away from home. One of the stops along the way is Feather Island, the home of all 'lost' canaries. 
 In The Dragons of Blueland, the dragon sets off to return to his own family that he hasn't seen since his captivity. He's anxious to be reunited. But when he returns, he learns that his own family--his very large family--has been trapped in their cave. The entrance is guarded by men intent on capturing them or perhaps even killing them. He needs to find a way to help his family! So he seeks out Elmer... 
 All three books are great. It's oh-so-easy to recommend these."

It wasn't one of the Seuss books that I owned growing up. But the christmas special--the cartoon--is one I've seen dozens and dozens of times. The book itself is lovely. If you love one, you'll love the other. 
 So in case you're unfamiliar with the book or special, The Grinch hates Christmas. His neighbors, the Whos in Who-ville, love Christmas. He is super-cranky this year, and, he decides to steal it. He thinks Christmas is all about the stuff. Take the stuff, do away with it altogether, right? Wrong. The Whos in Who-ville teach the Grinch a lesson about joy. 
 One of my favorite things about it is it's just SO quotable. Here are a few of my favorite lines: 
 Every who down in Who-ville liked Christmas a lot...But the Grinch, who lived just north of Who-ville, did NOT! 
 And THEN they'd do something he liked least of all! Every who down in Who-ville, the tall and the small, would stand close together, with Christmas bells ringing. They'd stand hand-in-hand. And the Whos would start singing. They'd sing! And they'd sing! AND they'd SING! SING! SING! 
 Then he slid down the chimney. A rather tight pinch. But, if Santa could do it, then so could the Grinch. 
 Then the last thing he took was the log for their fire! Then he went up the chimney, himself, the old liar. 
 It came without ribbons! It came without tags! It came without packages, boxes, or bags!"""

The story is one of how a young boy living in poverty in New Orleans got his first horn. It's reader-friendly, and the illustrations by James Bernardin make it appealing. (Did I ever tell you about my criteria for choosing a book to do a book report? This is when I was eight. Large print, pictures, and short.) All that being said, I found this one to be a bit lacking. Perhaps if I hadn't just read another biography of Armstrong; perhaps if it was a little less fictional, but why talk of perhaps. 
 I think you're either a person who likes fictional dialogue inserted into your biographies...or you don't. For those that love nonfiction in and of itself and are more interested in facts than fictional it-could-have-beens then this one might disappoint. But I realize that there are readers who don't mind the cushioning of facts with a nice story. The storytelling is good. There aren't flaws in the writing itself. It's just that there is so very much that I think is fictional in this story that I think it should be classified as fiction not biography."

Living in a shelter with her mother and her younger brother, she greatly misses the life she knew back home. But political unrest has put her father in danger, and her mother is in the US, seeking asylum for her whole family. Meanwhile, Anais must go to a new school, learn a new language, and deal with a different culture where almost nothing makes sense. To help adjust to her new life, her grandmother tells her she must find one good thing about America every day. Thus begins her series of delightful and charming letters to Oma. On some days, it is very hard for her think of even one good thing; on other days - especially when she discovers pizza and ice cream for the first time - it is easy. The enjoyment of this tale arises not only from seeing America through the eyes of a young immigrant child, but also in her discovery of new things and her growth in knowledge and maturity.

To be honest, it traumatized me a little bit and I wasn't sure how I would feel when I re-read Alice in Wonderland in the future... and I'm happy to say that the charm of the story still exists, even after reading some rather disturbing accounts of its author. 
 My memories of Alice in Wonderland are clouded quite a bit by the Disney film - but I have some memories of reading this book as a child and not liking it much. As an adult, I found I enjoyed the book a whole lot more. The puns, the humor and the songs (which used to bore me) came to life and made me laugh and shake my head in amusement. I found similarities in the writing style of Lewis Carrol and L. Frank Baum (especially in the use of puns), as I read both series parallel to one another. 
 I love ending out each year by reading classics, books that I intended to make time for during the year and just couldn't. Alice in Wonderland was a light, easy to read pick during a week that is normally chaotic and with my enjoyment of the book this time around, I might just have to make it a yearly happening."

A young girl named Karana is stranded on an island with her brother Ramo when they miss the canoe sent to take their tribe to the mainland. The siblings wait for the canoe to return, but it does not. 
 Ramo is attacked and killed by a pack of wild dogs, leaving Karana alone on the island. In a vow to revenge her brother's death, Karana kills many of the dog pack, but finds herself with a change of heart when confronted with the leader, who she names Rontu, which means ""yellow eyes"". 
 Karana takes care of herself, hunting and fishing for survival. She makes a shelter and she and Rontu live in peace. When her tribe returns, Karana hides in a cave until she encounters Tutok, a young woman of the tribe. They befriend each other and exchange gifts until the tribe leaves and once more, Karana is alone on the island. 
 Karana grows older and Rontu passes away. She adopts a new pup that looks like Rontu and names him Rontu-Aru, which means ""son of Rontu"". She lives in her solitude for many years until a great ship visits the island and she decides to approach it's inhabitants. They give her a new, and uncomfortable dress, but Karana decides that to live her new life, she must change her ways. The story ends with Rontu Aru and Karana heading to the mainland. 
 This story was well-written, but I felt like the moral was that Karana changed herself to be accepted in the western world. It almost implied [to me] that the Native Americans should be grateful for the life we have bestowed upon them, even if it is uncomfortable at first. I worry for Karana's happiness on the mainland. I think it will be too constricting for her lifestyle. I liked her more when she was free and uncaged.

Surely, his Uncle Jasper would understand, but no, Sam has been scheduled to leave for boarding school. 
 When he shares this information with his two friends, Roger, and Joey, they have another idea. Sam can hide in a cave until the game. Not the best solution, but it's better than missing the game altogether. However, the discovery of a box of bones, a cave-in, and a message that hints at a treasure gives Sam another idea. Find the treasure and buy his independence. 
 Sam, Joey, and Roger then embark on an adventure filled with one obstacle after another, a more than curious Sheriff, a cantankerous librarian, and a cave guarded by a red dragon. These young men are in way over their head. Will the old dragons prove to be friendly or are they the enemy. 
 I really enjoyed the history involved and, of course, the dragons. C. Lee McKenzie has created a great tale full of adventure, a thriller that kept this reader turning the page. 
 Sign of the Green Dragon is an excellent middle-grade mystery. It reminded me of the Nancy Drew Mysteries I used to lose myself in as a youngster."

 Apart from our typical Bengali ghosts,the haunting spirits and mysterious incidents of this book came as sort of a relief. I am in love with Chris Priestley's writing to be honest. 2 books,both are neat and the stories are organized in such a way that there's no way one can put down the book in the middle. Just imagine yourself,reading a bone-chilling novel,finding the shadows move around you,the characters from the novel becoming so much realistic all on a sudden but you are unable to put down the book no matter how scared you are. So you just give up trying and protect yourself under the shelter of the blanket. You are sweating but yet you are reading that book. How sad! Yes,I was in that sad position. *sigh 
 What kept me going is the most interesting question asked again and again in the book,which is also the question I always ask myself before reading a book.

 Sophie is found floating in a cello after a ship is lost. A young man called Charles fosters her, and they live the wonderfully eccentric life I longed for when I was 9 or 10. However, as Sophie grows up, Authority steps in and demands that she no longer lives with a single man who is no relative, and Charles and Sophie run away to Paris. Here, Sophie meets Matteo, a boy who lives on the roofs of Paris, and they set off to seek Sophie's mother. 
 The language in this book is marvellous- Sophie looks like a Maths lesson in grey shorts; Charles is like a well mannered panther... how could you not fall in love with a book like this? It is a classic in the making."

I loved all the comic books that I used to read as a kid, but over the years I've gotten away from the worlds of Batman and Superman. Graphic novels are kind of like comic books, but each book usually tells a self-contained story instead of being one part in an ongoing series. Also, unlike comic books, it's socially acceptable for a grown man to read a graphic novel in public! 
 I had never actually read any of the ""Boxcar Children"" mysteries by Gertrude Chandler Warner, so I was really excited to find this graphic novel at my library. The Boxcar Children are two boys and two girls who become orphans after their parents die. Afraid that they might get split up by their foster parents, the children decide to run off together. They end up building a camp in the woods, and taking shelter inside of an abandoned railroad boxcar. The Boxcar Children impressed me with their resourcefulness, and they did a pretty good job of running a house by themselves. 
 One thing I noticed about this book was that there was much more of an emphasis on pictures rather than words. Some pages only had one or two sentences. The illustrations did a great job of telling the story so I don't feel like I missed out on anything, but I'll definitely have to go back and get the original book for comparison! Most of the sequels that follow in this series are mystery chapter books, and that's definitely something that I'd be interested in reading. 
 From time to time, most kids come to wonder what would happen if they were suddenly alone in the world. I think that the Boxcar Children were lucky to have had each other to rely on when their parents died, and that was a big reason why they were so successful in the woods. Have you ever thought about what it would be like to live on your own? Would you feel lonely, or scared? Or maybe you might enjoy the time to yourself?"

In the Mushy Gushy Valentime, Junie B. Jones class is celebrating Valentine's Day. When Junie B. receives a special valentine, she tries to solve the mystery and discover her secret admirer. 
 People either seem to love or hate Junie B. Jones. Her incorrect grammar and crazy behavior drives some parents crazy. Some people think that she is a bad role model young children. If you agree with that side, this book probably isn't for you. I fall on the other side of the argument and see Junie B. Jones as more humorous, even though as an adult some of the language can get a tad annoying and is pretty unrealistic for someone in kindergarten. 
 Like in the other Junie B. Jones books, a situation that could happen in kindergarten is amplified by her large personality. In this book specifically, the boy Junie B. always fights with ends up being her secret admirer. Throughout the series, the two call each other names constantly and she even dubs him ""Meanie Jim."" I can see how this plot could be problematic for some parents. Even though it's only kindergarten, this doesn't really model a healthy relationship and could promote the idea that if you like someone, then it more socially acceptable to make fun of them than express your true feelings. 
 Even though Junie B. Jones hints that this ""isn't a good start"" for a relationship, she ultimately agrees to keep Jim's secret and continue fighting with him so none of his friends know that he likes her. Some people will say this is reading too much into the situation, that they are only children in kindergarten, and so they have no idea what they're doing. On the other hand, some people will not enjoy this type of plot line. If you feel strongly either way, just remember that if you are considering to let your child read this book. 
 Overall, Junie B. Jones and the Mushy Gushy Valentime isn't my favorite in the series because I feel like it isn't as humorous as some of the others and for some reason the language in this book annoyed me more than it did in the others. I rate this book a 3 out of 5 stars for being okay, but not my favorite.

Her name is Cindy and she claims that her brother was taken by a ghost. It's not too far fetched for the three to decide to help her because they believe that is what in deed had happened given the weird things that seem to happen in Spooksville. Like Adam, Cindy and her family had recently moved in to live in the house her father had inherited. That sad thing is she lost her father because he died and now her brother got kidnapped by a ghost. I can't imagine how that could make anyone feel other then dead inside. 
 The four of them decide that they are going to try and find out what happened to Cindy's brother. They start tracing clues and going places. They look for what makes sense and then they try to put it all together so that they can better understand the gravity of the situation. I don't think anyone could truly understand the gravity of any situation that seems to take place in the town. 
 I do like how the characters seem to find adventure and mystery. I like how the story is written and how it pulls you in and I am sure anyone that has read them will feel similar. I also like how they are short and fairly quick and easy to read. There are some days where I really want to read but I don't want to be stuck with a book that will take hours to finish. These don't take long at all and are always wrapped up with a nice little bow at the end so that you have closure to the story but there is still room for it to be added to. I think that is part of what makes them very enjoyable to read."

Her Grammy Claire was the one person in her life that was there for her and the only person in her family that she truly cared about. The day of her Grammy's funeral she receives a certified letter from her Grammy. The letter begins a sort of treasure hunt that has keys, and riddles that lead and unlock things that only Tara is meant to understand. Her Grammy was a researcher of Butterflies on the Island of Chuuk. All of the letters that Tara received would emphasize how important her quest was and mostly how dangerous it was. 
 This whole book is based on this treasure hunt that Tara goes on, she drags her Sister Riley along as well. Although I am sure it was Riley decided to go along since she was left deflated when their father had stood her up and lied about sending her a plane ticket so she could visit him. Their mother is in a state of depression and not in the right mind, so she allows the children to go on this quest with the supervision of Grammy Claire's attorney and close friend. 
 It turns out that Grammy Claire's letters couldn't have been any more true. The girls needed to save Grammy Claire's research. They needed to save the butterflies because there were a number of suspects mentioned in Grammy Claire's letters that told the girls to trust no one. To trust no one at all, because if they would start to trust that their lives too would be in danger. It was really hard for Tara not to trust because most the people she had come into contact with on the island seemed like could people, with good hearts and good intentions. But that doesn't meant that they did have good hearts and or good intentions. 
 As the book progresses you get to learn more about Tara and Riley's father, their mother, their Grammy's life's work and the people that their Grammy had known and were friends with on the island. The descriptions of the butterflies and how special they are and how brilliantly wonderful they appear when they are spoke about in the books is just wonderful and breathtaking. I could honestly see a producer turning this book into a movie, it would be just magical. 
 I really enjoyed reading this book and I look forward to reading more books by Miss Little in the future. She is a wonderful author that has a magical way in the use of her words. Her stories without a doubt pull you in until the very end!"

 Seriously, Dr. Seuss at his best! I remember having this book read to me as a little girl, but I'm going to be honest and say I've not read it to my little ones. It's one and has always been one of my favorite stories, but when you see it every year on television you sort of forget to sit down and read it with your kids. 
 What a great book to sit down with and talk to our kids while reading it. Why do you think Christmas is important? Why do our kids? It's such a powerful story about really remembering the greater meaning behind the holiday, it's not just about the toys. My kids have seen the cartoon every year, but sitting with them and reading HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS was more fun than watching the cartoon (but we will still watch), it was fun talking to them--I sometimes forget to stop while watching a program and find out what they are thinking. Reading to them allows me to remember to take the time. 
 This is one I'm sure you read as a kid and should read with yours :) Highly recommend!"

The book imagines hibernation as a train of hollow logs that runs through the forest on tracks of sticks and gathers all the animals for their winter sleep. Big and small, pajama-clad adorable critters carry their bedding into the logs and make themselves comfy, while two bears, the train's engineer and conductor, respond to a variety of complaints and technical difficulties. Eventually, as snow begins to fall, the animals settle down and fall asleep. The text is written in rhymed couplets, move along just as the train would which sets a good pace for younger readers. The illustrations are done well with lots of colors and textures that make you wish you had the animal before you so could hug and snuggle with them. In an appended note, Meadows discusses hibernation, ""deep sleepers,"" and ""light sleepers."" Hibernation Station is a charming and sweet read."

After a series of events he finally finds just where he belongs. 
 I really enjoyed this book. The rhymes were perfect and the illustrations went along with them well. It was a cute story with a feel good ending. I liked that Gerald's unique speech made him stick out at first and then he was able to use it. Every kid as unique qualities and it is hard for them to like them when kids all want to be the same and fit together but later on you learn that these qualities that set you apart are good.

The hacks and the whole school atmosphere, brilliant! And Maggie's friendship with Lena is a match made in heaven (it was almost a little too perfect). The struggles they face with friendships and families felt real (it made me a little mad Maggie let go of her two original best friends so easily). 
 I understand that you have to suspend reality a bit in a book like this, but something about this book... whether it was the hacks or the perfect friendship or the mostly oblivious adults... something made this book a bit too unbelievable. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed it! 
 The ending gives the appearance of having everything wrapped up, but I have a feeling there will be a sequel... Lena has to tell us the secret about her parents and Maggie's grandpa's auto parts business still isn't fully resolved ."

 This is my first time reviewing for Disney-Hyperion Publisher, and boy am I glad that I've been given an opportunity by Disney-Hyperion to review their ARCs for they made the child in me giggle in amusement when I read their books, especially this one: Aliens on Vacation by Clete Smith. 
 Aliens on Vacation is about a young boy helping out his grandmother in a bed and breakfast specially for space tourists. READ: Aliens. 
 The story was really amusing, funny, and well written. I daresay this story will amuse not only children, but adults as well too. 
 The storyline was original and highly imaginative, and with loads of moral packed in in. 
 I rate this book 4.5 out of 5 stars, and highly recommends this book to children 8 years and above."

 Yawn. As a girl who enjoys survival stories, man against nature and all that jazz, I wanted to like this. Because I had heard that this was about a girl stranded on an island alone. And something about dolphins, maybe she could speak to them or something. And even when I knew she was native to the island, I thought there'd be some struggling for survival on her own, especially when the wild dogs came into play. 
 Nope. The girl survives more disasters than the X-Men. 
 Even that could've been passable, had she been three-dimensional. She wasn't even a Mary Sue; she was just some cardboard semblance of a person. She rarely had emotion. I never felt anything with her. I couldn't tell you anything about her personality if I had a gun to my head (she likes pretty things to wear, I guess?). Karana is honestly the most boring narrator I've ever had. Was Mr. O'Dell afraid of getting a girl's voice wrong? I don't know but seriously, this book was dull. 
 Spoiler Version, AKA: Karana Telling Us Her Story Condensed: 
 ""So the white people came to our village and killed otters and were going to trade us beads for them... But then they killed our men. My dad the chief was one of them, but whatever. Another boat comes and we decide to leave with them because we can't survive with most of the men gone, but my brother was stupid and stayed on the island so I jumped off to be with him (he's young and stuff). A day later he died, and I buried him before he stank, and swore vengeance on the wild dogs who killed him but didn't really cry or anything. But I tamed the leader of the pack so the vengeance thing fell through. Then the dog died because I was on the island awhile. It made me sad, and I buried him before he stank. Then I drugged his puppy so I could tame it and have it live with me. I also had birds, and otters. I'm pretty much an Indian Snow White. Then there was a white chick I shared words with. Pretty much the only human interaction I had for ten years (actually, I have no idea how long I was there, because screw counting anything important, I'll just reiterate stuff you know). She left, and I mourned her more than my own brother. There was a lot of deus ex machina; didn't have to hardly do anything myself, like the sea elephant who killed another one so I could just take the teeth without working for them. I killed a squid. There was a tsunami. I took off with white men at the end, leaving everything I've known for strangers. Oh, and the ship with all my people? Totally sank, so all my hopes of being reunited with my sister are gone. But whatever. Hey, look, dolphins, like in the title!"""

Grumpy, he returns home determined to never play in the wind again. His mom suggests that he find a way to play with the wind, not against it. He comes up with the perfect windy, day solution. 
 My Thoughts- 
 First, let's look at the story. This is a wonderful tale involving the age-old principle of perseverance. Argyle attempts to play cards, build a spider web and many more fun activities, but the wind keeps destroying his work. Like many children, he gets frustrated, angry and then gives up. 
 His wise mom tells him to, ""Figure out something to play in the wind."" At first, Argyle grumbles, but then he takes a moment to think and wonder if maybe he can try something new, something he hasn't played yet. He becomes determined to overcome his problem. Not only that, but he uses all of his previous failed attempts at play to build something that will work with the wind. Voila, by cutting, knitting, painting and gluing he constructs a kite. His previous failures lead to his new success! Great moral. 
 Of course, besides the story, we have the illustrations. I enjoyed the color choices, in particular, the bold orange of the string and the fox pelts. I also liked that the story and the pictures combine to bring the reader into the action. Every time the wind blows it goes ""Woosh"", but instead of reading what happens, the illustrations are used to show us the disastrous results. 
 One side point, Argyle fox always wears an argyle scarf (thus his name I assume), and I wonder if children will actually know what an argyle pattern means without an explanation. 
 This is a really cute story with playtime activities, emotions, and problems that kids will relate too. I think it will be a fun read for kids so I'm giving it 4 stars!"

 The Story: David, aka ""Scrub"", is being sent off to live with his grandmother in Washington, where she runs an inn called the Intergalactic Bed & Breakfast. He would much rather stay at home in Florida and practice basketball with his friends, but his parents are determined, so off he goes. 
 Things get weird right from the start. The clientele at the Inn are strange, some eating aluminum foil and drinking bleach. Others wear tacky tourist garb and sport dark sunglasses. It doesn't take Scrub long to realize that the name of his Grandma's Inn has a double meaning. 
 Knowing the truth brings Scrub all sorts of problems as he is brought into his Grandma's world of ""hide the alien"". Soon he is in waist deep, and though it is fun and exciting, he knows that if he messes up he could blow his grandma's cover and bring down mean Sheriff Tate. And worse, he gets a shock when the girl he likes turns out to be Tate's daughter. 
 My Thoughts: This is a delightful, fun hearted book. From the get go Scrub is a well liked character. Even when he doesn't know about the aliens, he is kind and helpful with them, ignoring what he believes are just physical handicaps. Once he learns the truth, he helps his grandma out in every way he can, while still being the typical middle schooler, playing basketball and making friends. 
 I loved all the different aliens that appear. It is so much fun to watch them come and go at the Inn. As an added bonus, each chapter begins with the drawing of a portal in which a different alien appears. The characters are bold and hilarious. The plot is easy to follow so you know right where things are headed, but the little side jumps add plenty of fun. 
 The ending is a great twist. I can't tell you, but it was not what I expected, so I loved it even more. I say, go get this one.

I really like Gee's writing usually, and this wasn't a bad read, but it wasn't one that I couldn't put down. One of the best things about Gee's writing is that he sets his stories in New Zealand, which always adds something a bit different to readers who aren't familiar with the shaky isles (or might even think NZ is part of Australia ;). The landscape is an important part of this book, and that did give it an edge. Liked it but didn't love it, but definitely a good read for those who aren't familiar with NZ young adult fiction."

 Alternative Title: The Satanic Mill 
 When I started reading it the story felt somewhat familiar. It was only then that I realised this book had been translated into Dutch a long time ago (as De Meester van de Zwarte Molen) and that many of my friends had read this while we were young. 
 And it makes for a perfect children's story. Krabat gets to work in a mill, but soon finds out the Master is training them in black arts and mysterious things are going on. But it's impossible to flee as every road will take Krabat back to the mill... 
 I liked it. I think I would have really enjoyed it had I been a bit younger. It fits perfectly with the other books we read as children. It's not too long either, would recommend for children around age 8-11. 
 Thanks to the publisher and Netgalley for providing me with a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review!"

It is too perfect, and if I'd written it, I might have changed one word, and one word different would make it less than perfect. I would not want a single word of this book different. 
 Usually, when I read a book I love, I want to eat it. I didn't want to eat this book. I wanted to hold it to my chest and squeeze it so hard it became a part of me, absorbed into my heart. 
 This book made me want to use adjectives like whimsical, magical, musical, and lovely. But those words do not do it justice. This book made me clutch my steering wheel as I listened, heart thumping, for the book to race to its conclusion. It made me ache with wanting what Sophie wanted. It made me burst into tears at the last line. 
 I can't begin to do this book justice with a review. I fell in love with every character, with every twist, with the language the author uses. I never wanted it to end, but I couldn't wait to see what happened next, to see how it would turn out. When it ended, I felt like I'd been clubbed in the heart. I just wanted to sit there, stunned, saying ""Oh my god, oh my god,"" over and over, because I couldn't think of a single other thing to say. 
 I don't know who I would recommend this book to. It's too special to me to say that I'd want everyone to read it. Some people might not 'get it,' might not fall in love with its loveliness. But it is now on my list of favorite books of all time, with the likes of Jane Eyre and To Kill a Mockingbird. It's that good. It transcends the 5 star rating. There should be a special category for books this good, an exemption that lets readers give a 6-star review. Even that would not be enough."

The three stories are full of adventure and imagination, and good for readers as young as five. In the first story, we get to know the father, Elmer(when he was a boy), and Boris the baby dragon. Elmer goes through many trials and cleverly outsmarts all the wild animals who have trapped the baby dragon to work as their ferry across the river so they can avoid the alligators. Through use of Elmer's carefully chosen supplies, he tricks lions, tigers, bears, and alligators by using things such as hair brushes and bows, bubble gum, lollipops, and compasses. The whole book is pretty silly, but it's a good heartwarming story for kids ages 5-12. Very fanciful and fun."

In this I was mistaken, but in the most fortunate way possible. This book is an overwhelmingly enjoyable, witty, striking commentary on what the author describes as the ""tragicomedy"" of life. 
 That word, ""tragicomedy"", I believe sums up the overarching tone of the book. The setting is framed around a father (the author) sitting in a flimsy air raid bunker in his backyard, with nothing but a child's picture book to keep his family distracted while the land around them is being bombed. Since he can't remember the precise details of the fables, he decides to fill in holes from his own imagination, as well as make interpretations about their often ambiguous morality using the more pragmatic side of his mind. The combination of these two forces - whimsical comedy and a sort of tragic indifference - is what makes this book great. 
 Overall, entertaining fables, and some razor-edged commentary on human psychology are blended perfectly together into a fairly quick read."

When he got home he twisted the object each and every way he could. He could even wear it as a bracelet. As he began to get sleepy he decided to hide his treasure in his nest so it would be safe. It was his most valued treasure! 
 The next morning as soon as his eyes opened he started digging around in the nest where he had hidden his treasure. But to no avail he could not find his shiny treasure. He assumes someone must have stolen his treasure. When Sarah the sparrow showed up chirping and chattering away he told her someone had stolen his most precious treasure. He decides they will take the roles of Sherlock Holmes, Davey of course and Sarah as his sidekick Watson. They would start an investigation of the stolen treasure. They ended up accusing some of their friends. Wish was not very nice. 
 Will they be able to figure out who took Davey's treasure? Will he continue to accuse more of his friends hurting their feelings in the process? Sarah realized this was not the way to find his treasure by offending his friends. 
 This is a darling book. The author has a talent not of writing alone but of teaching. Teaching a child about trust, definitely not to assume things, and to treat you neighbors with respect. Also that friends are to be valued. 
 I loved the characters especially the little cutie Sarah the sparrow. She was a true friend. Even Mr. Whitetail was quite the gentleman even though his honor was being challenged. 
 The illustrator captured the little pair of detectives and their antics while investigating the missing treasure. Also that of Mr. Whitetail and Mr. Bushtail and their habitats. 
 I highly recommend this book.

 This is a funny, science-fiction romp that'll please kids looking for laughs. If the story had been a little tighter (and the book a bit shorter), I think it would have been near perfect. There's a slight romantic subplot that, while it feels fine for the characters and it's not gratuitous, did elicit that ""Is this a kissing book?"" response from me. I think the book would have been stronger without that. Overall, a nice debut and I'll be keeping my eye on Clete Smith.

Although I still enjoyed reading it now, I also found something about this bear pretty confusing. He is obviously a child getting funny ideas and having typical children's adventures; at the same time he gives adults ""hard stares"", looks for ways to make money and argues over one pound when it seems to be too high a price which I wouldn't call typical children's behavior. 
 Well, let's say he is just an unusual character (he's a bear after all). I couldn't help but wonder if Mr and Mrs Brown are ever going to teach him some basic rules. They give him pocket money and take care of him, so apparently he is like a child to them, but when it comes to preventing him from another silly thing, they just give him all the freedom. Ok, if they had stopped him, there would be no adventures, hence no book, I get it. 
 It must be a great book for children who won't overanalyse Paddington's actions and judge the way the Browns bring him up by analogy with real life. The book is funny, well-written but easy-to-read, ... and it was bound to succeed as what can be cuter than a little adventurous bear?"

 I plucked this off a display table at the library last week, a table probably inspired by the recent release of a film based on the book. I have not seen the movie, but I remembered the book and the cartoon movie from elementary school. I remember being really overwhelmed by this book and the cartoon and feeling terribly guilty on behalf of all humans. My parents then helped us to buy and plant a tree in our backyard. I took crazy care of that tree and recently, when I went by our old house, I was happy to see that it had grown very tall and now peeks over the roof of the house. I say all this - I was a pretty sensitive kid and was also raised Catholic. Let's not even talk about the kind of guilt capable of being felt by such a child. 
 Now, I read it with a better understanding of the world and it's even more directly relevant. I know many people say that this book is too black-and-white, that the message is part of a great liberal indoctrination campaign. I truly don't understand how teaching children to love and respect the environment is bad. I feel like you must be one selfish asshole if you're more worried about your Thneed than your future child's ability to play under the truffula trees. 
 This book will definitely have a place in my child's library. And I hope they are thoroughly indoctrinated by it."

 Don't be a spoilsport. 
 I and my wife are surely reading to our little Who's when they are born. 
 The undercurrent of the story presents to you a question as to not ""How"" but rather ""Why"" did the the Grinch stole the Christmas from the merry making Who people. 
 Every Who down in Whoville liked Christmas a lot 
 But the Grinch who lived just North of Whoville did not! 
 The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season! 
 Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason. 
 It could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight. 
 It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right. 
 But I think that the most likely reason of all 
 May have been that his heart was two sizes too small. 
 He loathes the idea of celebration and fun. Sweets and light and everything associated with the near end of December. 
 Grinch is like that Grumpy old cat 
 Just outside the perimeters of the happy village of our little people, lives in a cave The Grinch. Old, unhappy and nasty. He plans to hijack the opportunity from the Whoville to say Merry Christmas to each other. 
 Slowly and stealthily (and yes, sometimes not so STEALTHILY) starts taking away candies, sweets, gifts and the decorations. He relishes a sadistic joy in his heart and tugs all the happiness of the festival in his dark cave. 
 However things do not turn out as planned. 
 And he realizes what's in fact true. 
 The moral message that it sends out - in this ever twisting, looping and cannon balling style of writing - is that the joy is not only materialistic. It's much profounder than that. 
 Change in heart and the mettle to accept your shortcomings along with the trademark rhyming scheme of Dr. Seuss makes it a book that you simply can't rate less than 5. 
 The warmth in your heart can kindle about the coldest of woods."

No one is listening until it is to late. Great for reading to your children when they are young. I also think it would be a good story to read to teens when talking about going green or changing the way we use energy. My 12 yr old was intranced by the story, he did read it on the nook which adds to it with tech. But it would be a good start for questions like why and when did he write this story. Was he before his time in seeing a bigger issue? Do you think it makes a difference when children read stories like this? etc. you get the point. If you have little one this is a must read."

 Trouble Rides a Fast Horse starts off with Katy who is in guise (literally) as a horse named Lady and her friend Sandra getting train for a horse show. Aunt Jenny Tomlinson mentioned her suspicion about the horse turn-around rate at the Chase's place. This bring the Fallon Five which includes Sandra, Babs, Rona, Mark, Toni. Katy makes six but sense she is a horse, she is limited in her communication with her five friends. They discovered a smuggling ring and now need to figure out how to save the stolen horses and to show prove that there are more things going on at the Chance's place. 
 Trouble Rides a Fast Horse is a great story for grade 4 to middle school level. Readers in the United States would need to get familiar with the British terminologies such as a flashlight being refer to a torch. The book is also a great way to introduce grade 4 to middle school of the horse competition in a British culture. Not many of these young readers travel to England or own horses to understand the difference between the American and British horse competition. 
 Another thing the story did was that horses and people think differently. The story did reminds me of Gulliver's Travel when Gulliver met the Equine (intellectual horses). I might have given the story away at this point. 
 The only thing I didn't like and it is such a small minor thing is THE End at the end of the story. The adventures still continue for Katy. At some point she would have to be a human girl again so the story really didn't end. I would give the book a 4.5 stars but the .5 is not part of the rating system."

 This quote: 
 ""After that, me and that Grace made squinty eyes at each other. Plus also we crossed our arms. And we tapped our angry feet. 
 Only pretty soon we got tired of that. 'Cause fighting with your friends is not that fun. 
 That's how come both of us hugged each other. And we said a 'pology."" 
 We would all do well to remember friendship and how to apologize. Too often, if we do apologize, it's a non-apology such as ""I'm sorry you feel..."" rather than ""I was wrong. I'm sorry."" 
 Junie B. books are great for any age... 1 to 99. I'd suggest opening the book and your mind and try reading it out loud to your elementary-school-aged child. You'll laugh together:)"

 You know how Huckleberry Finn is basically an adult book now read mostly by children? This is kind of similar: it's a children's book with the occassional digression into details suited to adult readers (like tecnhichalites on how the church works in an area). 
 The story itself is basically a boys own adventure about being a little Norman nobleman, but without the high-adrenaline exploits you might assume from that genre. 
 I thought the Librivox recording, though legible on high volume, was of relatively poor technical quality. I'm not refering to the readers here, but to the quality of the reproduction of sound: in one chapter it seemed to me like the volume rose and fell in sharp cycles, and in later chapters, the recording sounded very tinny."

Of course I would never want him in my house and I do not envy Brown Family, but I find this bear absolutely a charmer. He perceives the world as a normal creature not touched by big city flame: straightforward and literally. That puts him in so many comical situations that you cannot hold a smile.

But the book is good: it has a solid plot, suspense, and mystery. Every character has its own voice and opinion. However good it is I still had major issues reading it. From the point of view of a young reader the book is full of rebellion, challenges, adventure and freedom. From an adult point of view I can see only disobedience, disrespect towards adults, danger and irresponsibleness. 
 I really disliked the children from the book because of their lies to the parents and their irresponsible behavior. One situation just killed me: when they got new guests, they could not actually provide any basic comfort to the guests (and we must take into consideration that all children were involved into the hotel business from early childhood); the maximum effort was to provide semi-clean linen; the rest is the description of how they enjoyed their freedom and idleness. Really? That's the idea of 17 year old and 15 year old about hotel management. Then I guess parents made some major mistakes in their upbringing. That all really gets in the way and spoiled the impression, and I tried to like the characters, really... but just could not. 
 From the adventure point of view I have no problems (keeping in might again that this is the book for 11-13 year old). Real pirates, danger to kill the environment of the bay, loneliness, fear and courage: everything was in the order and from this perspective I liked the book. 
 Altogether, I think it is an easy, exciting read for teenagers, but the characters' behavior does not set a good example."

I don't let this kind of designation sway me from reading something that sounds like it might have something to offer. In this case, I'm not sure I'd go with 'excellent', but Beyond the Deepwoods is entertaining. It's a familiar type of story with an orphan who doesn't fit in and leaves home on a quest to find himself, meeting many strange and wondrous creatures on his adventures along the way. That's about as much plot as it has, really, but the writing it good, reminiscent of older stories such as Alice in Wonderland, Gulliver's Travels, or The Wizard of Oz.

 When Natalie and Ian steel their plane tickets to Japan and hijack their babysitter, Amy and Dan are forced to rely on Alistair Oh to get them to Japan and the next clue. After throwing Irina off their trail the three are kidnapped by the Holts and then chased by the Japanese members of the Tomas branch called yakusa, who are intent on killing them. With all these people out to get them will they survive to find the next clue and can they trust their companion not to be the one who stabs them in the back? 
 With a multi author series you had to know someone would eventually drop the ball and not remember all the facts present in previous novels. Lerangis is unfortunately the one who let the ball drop. While his plot is still interesting, the contradictions between this installment and the first two novels are massive. For example if you've read the second novel you'll remember that when Mr. McIntyre makes his appearance in the second novel to find out why the tracking device he placed on Grace's cat has stopped moving, he encounters Alistair who accused him of stealing a clue. When Alistair storms off he leaves the device behind and Mr. McIntyre has it during the conversation with the Man in black. In this novel Alistair has the tracking device on him on the plane. Also Amy and Dan claim to have believed Alistair was the one who planted it on them, but no mention of that was ever made in the second novel To list all the discrepancies would be time consuming at best and probably highly tedious to read, but that give you an idea of the discrepancies I found. Considering a child's memory is usually significantly better than an adult's it surprises me that Lerangis was not more careful when he picked up his installment of the series. With Korman having followed through so well, it's disappointing that Lerangis dropped the ball. Another way this installment differs from others in the series is while the first two novels were filled with historical information offering children an entertaining way to learn, this offers very little in educational information and focuses more on the characters than anything else. It includes the start of a preteen love story plot before decimating that near the end of the novel and other subplots involving the pasts of secondary characters. It was a close third person, fairly well written with a fast paced plot, but wasn't told primarily in Amy and Dan's point of view, but more in the points of views of what were previously secondary characters. 
 My final issue with this book is the ending was confusing, under explained and didn't completely make sense. 
 While most of the characters presented were fairly well presented they didn't remain true to form with their previous appearances. Amy becomes kind of sappy, Dan is almost a brat and the two seem to fight like cats and dogs. Ian is portrayed as less mental and more emotional and though some serious depth is added to this character it doesn't fit with his previous appearances in the series. Irina and the Holts were apparently of little interest to Lerangis as their appearances were a cameo at best. Jonah Wizard and Mr. McIntyre apparently didn't interest him at all as they didn't appear in this novel. Alistair Oh receive some major character development as well but again not all of it fits with his previous appearances. 
 Overall this was a good installment, but not a great one. I look forward to seeing what the next author in the series does with this development."

We thought that it was a good story, but it was very slow, almost to the point of boring. Tara was a hard main character to like, she was grieving through the entire story so she was always crying, always sad, always in grief. The plot unraveled so slowly with all the letters only leading to more clues, and more clues, and more clues. There was so much build up that when we finally got to the end, it was almost a let down. My daughter, who is 12, just never really connected to the characters. She never got really drawn in to the story because she would say it was boring, and each chapter never really felt like you were progressing. We liked the butterflies and the descriptions of them and the island, but we still felt like there should have been more to them than what it turned out to be. The last 50 pages or so picked up and there was some action and a twist, but really we could have went from chapter 2 to the end and not read anything in between and still felt like we knew the story. It had potential, it just kind of fell flat for us.."

I grew up on Busy, Busy World by Richard Scarry and Uncle Wiggily, by Howard Garis. Davey fits right in with those old classics. 
 Kids will relate to the story here: Davey had new treasure, and now it's gone. Someone must've stolen it! Davey finds a friend who agrees to go off and play detective with him, and they set off into the forest. Like kids everywhere, they establish the roles early on and keep reminding each other of them: Davey's the detective, while his friend, Sarah the sparrow, is his sidekick. 
 But I also love the language tricks we are playing all the way through the story. What do you do when you don't know what a thing is called? You take a verbal detour and describe it. The object Davey found, and is now missing, is a ""bendy, silver object full of twists and turns."" When the child sees the object in the wonderful illustration on the next page, he or she will laugh with immediate recognition and at the notion that this bird, clever as he may be, doesn't know the names of common office supplies. 
 The story teaches valuable lessons about friendship and trusting and communication while delighting the eye with rich illustrations of animals in the forest by Sarah Shaw. Don't hesitate for a minute. Your child will want to hear this story over and over again, and will make new discoveries with each reading."

 I liked this story well enough: it has the definite markings of a fairy tale, somehow reminding me of old legends from my home area. (I'm not German, but we do have our own tales dealing with similar themes, such as clever journeymen who manage to outsmart supernatural beings, etc.) 
 There was magic in the atmosphere here--no pun intended: though sorcery was obviously a strong theme, indeed, events and descriptions themselves, even of daily activities, always seemed to have been touched by something out of the ordinary. We get to discover this at the same time Krabat does, wondering more and more about his surroundings and why things are the way they are. 
 The writing style was fairly simple, easy to grasp and prompting imagery in an efficient way. Probably suffering from a ""lost in translation"" syndrome, though, as it sometimes felt a bit dry. (I tend to avoid judging harshly in such cases, since I wouldn't be able to compare with the original version.) 
 The downside (of sorts) is that, as in most fairytales, the characters aren't too developed, and used more to carry the story on their shoulders than as people with their own lives. For instance, we never get to know the singer's name , which makes her appear as a symbol more than as a real person. The way the relationship develops is clearly a device, and not believable in terms of ""falling in love the natural way"". Also, Krabat and the other guys don't question the Master's motives that much, even though they live in fear during a certain period of the year. 
 It probably works better as a story for younger readers: frightening in parts, but not gory, with darker aspects but ""appropriate"" morals. However, at the same time, it left me longing for more. The ending was rushed, in my opinion,, and I would have wanted to learn what happened to everyone else afterwards."

She read it to us at breakfast, and it matched perfectly the Advent devotion that we read together at church as we lit the second candle during worship. Including scripture from Isaiah about the voice crying in the wilderness to prepare for the coming of the Lord, the devotion reminded us not to be distracted by the materialism that fills the season, but to use even those distractions to remind us of what is truly important. I love that Dr. Seuss makes the same plea but leaves it open to each reader to define the undefinable spirit of Christmas."

It's in the vein of stories like Pinocchio or The Little Prince (or even the more modern Toy Story trilogy), showing how self-sacrifice and love (both given and received) lead to the deepest, most intrinsic kind of magic. The Velveteen Rabbit includes stunning passages such as: 
 ""Real isn't how you are made,"" said the Skin Horse. ""It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real."" 
 ""Does it hurt?"" asked the Rabbit. 
 ""Sometimes,"" said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. ""When you are Real you don't mind being hurt."" 
 The progression of the Rabbit's relationship with the Boy is sweet, subtle, and realistic. It's an emotionally honest story with a bittersweet ending. It's easy to tell why some books become childhood classics."

 (1969) by Patricia Coffin is one of those children's books that is remembered fondly by many, but almost impossible to find at present. I was curious about it, so I thought I'd keep an eye out for an inexpensive copy--which I finally did find a week or two ago. 
 Here's the blurb from the dust jacket: 
 Like Alice's rabbit hole, a closet in Puffin's house is the entrance to a magic world. Here two eleven-year-old girls, Puffin and her best friend, Mole, meet a wondrous assortment of mythological and fictional characters---from the Wizard of Oz to Fafnir, the fearsome dragon of the Niebelungenlied. Pervading all is the malevolent influence of the Gruesome Green Witch, a beautiful and evil avocado-colored creature. 
 The girls are arrested from trying to do homework without working papers, and then meet Merlin the Magician, who teaches them how to concentrate. They go to a ""Round Dance"" at the bottom of the sea, and King Neptune invites them into the Rock Candy Grotto where eating sweets prevents cavities. Their guide throughout is hand-high ""tumpte,"" a Swedish kind of elf, who they've saved from going up in smoke. 
 When the Gruesome Green Witch casts a spell of Matt, Puffin's suspended-from-school older brother, the magic turns to horror. Only Puffin can rescue him, and only she knows what the price will be. 
 The Tumpte, the trolls, and the Gruesome green Witch are freely adopted from Swedish folklore by Patricia Coffin, and handsomely illustrated by Peter Parnall's unique drawings. 
 This is a short book (85 pages) but one that is nicely produced. In keeping with the theme, all the text is printed in dark green, and in each of the very detailed black-and-while illustrations there are a few elements of the design that are highlighted in green ink as well. It's a very wild and imaginative story that would seem likely to appeal to the same kids who enjoy the Ruth Chew books. This book is perhaps written at a very slightly older reading level than Chew's stories about witches, but is certainly aimed at precisely the same audience. 
 However.... eh, I'm not sure that for an adult there's much here to gain one's attention. I think this is an example of a story that has tremendous sentimental appeal and meaning for those adults who had read it when they were young---but there isn't much of interest to the story for those who come to it later in life. I'm guessing that kids will still enjoy it, however. 
 As noted above, this is one of those books that is rather difficult to find---at present I only see five copies for sale on-line, and those are listed at ridiculously high prices. So, for me, the fun in the book was not about reading the story itself, but rather the ""thrill of the chase""----hunting down a very inexpensive copy that somehow got overlooked by everyone else."

 I had never heard - or at least had no memory - of 'The Lorax' before I saw the posters for the upcoming film adaptation. He was a strange orange sight I didn't understand. Now I've read his story and I intend to do so again and again. 
 This is a story of financial gain at the cost of the environment. It is a tale of greed and redemption. It shows us the benefits in standing up for others and not only thinking of ourselves. It is as relevant now as it was when it was first published. 
 The book does not begin as loud and colourful as many other of Seuss' stories. Instead, it is grey and dreary and pulls the reader in closer with the eerie quiet of the scenery. The first words of the story are like a breath, pulled from the lips of the reader, lost in an echo of a landscape. 
 In the beginning, the Lorax is an unanswered question. Who was he? Why did he disappear? There is only one person who can answer that question - the Once-ler - and we never see what he looks like. Instead we are told the story in a way which feels right, through a Whisper-ma-Phone. 
 Seuss uses such fresh imagery to contrast the gloom at the beginning of the book, showing how drastically everything has changed from what it once was. More importantly, he writes of ""back in the days"" in such a way that you can smell, hear and feel the wonders that you see on the page. 
 The story pits two figures against each other, the Lorax and the Once-ler. The Once-ler is enamored by the Truffula Trees. He only means to make something with the materials available to him but it isn't long before he is carried away with greed and is putting the needs of his business before all other things. The Lorax is the voice of reason against all of this. He speaks ""for the trees, for the trees have no tongues"" and takes care of the other animals in the area. 
 This book really touches on the subject of human rights. The Once-ler has found an inventive opportunity and is taking advantage of it. He is producing a product which people are buying. A Thneed is seemingly ludicrous but his sales are skyrocketing. It shows people's attachment to materialism and how we are willing to part with our money and put materialistic values above environmental ones if we can be persuaded that we need something. 
 In the words of the Once-ler, ""A Thneed's a Fine-Something-That-All-People-Need!"" However, it isn't something that benefits the Truffula Trees or any of the other creatures around. Their opinions and needs go unnoticed, except by the Lorax. He speaks for those who can't voice their own agonies. 
 The Once-ler is a creature of his own making. He shows us that we have to live with the consequences we set out for ourselves. None of us are innocent. Books are made by cutting down trees* and we benefit from them so much more than a Thneed but that doesn't mean that there aren't consequences to cutting them down. 
 The Lorax is a figure that everyone should look to emulate. What we can't do is wait and hope he will come back. We have to summon him by finding the Lorax in ourselves. We must do it before it is too late and well all end up as Once-lers. 
 'The Lorax' is a book which everyone should read. It is a story with a message that all people need.

 Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator picks up right where Charlie and the Chocolate Factory left off - with Wonka, Charlie, Grandpa Jo and the rest of the Bucket family inside the glass elevator on the way to start a new life in the factory. Wonka is as crazy as ever and the family - with the exception of Charlie and Grandpa Jo are none too impressed which leads to some funny scenes especially when Wonka plans to put the Glass Elevator into orbit so they can smash through the roof the factory. Funnily enough no one is very keen on this idea. Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator is a lot of fun especially when the elevator goes into orbit at the same time the much anticipated Space Hotel USA is due to launch - and Wonka, crack-pot that he is decides they should be the first people inside. Queue madness and Vernicious Knids and Charlie's grandparents drinking a little TOO much of a potion that makes them younger.

Up to now I've been pleasantly surprised by how much I've enjoyed titles that I wouldn't otherwise have given a second look. I'm sad to say this wasn't the case here. The story took too long 'setting things up' before the action described on the back cover got started. Then in the end it was all wound up in a neat package rather too swiftly. The story had potential but - for this reader - it fell short. I can't really explain why exactly, but I just couldn't bring myself to care about the characters and what happened to them. Cal's 'voice' was charming at first, but began to feel forced. 
 There were moments I enjoyed, and I approve of the subtle - or not so subtle - nudges about protecting species such as seals, avoiding the dreadful pollution of beaches by oil spills, and the shameful habit of looting items from shipwrecks."

In simple, fun language, it describes the life of Paul Erdos, the mathematician who loved math and loved to share it with others. His enthusiasm for numbers is infectious! Everyone knows someone like Erdos, who ""doesn't like rules."" This book shows the positive side of being a different thinker. The illustrations are bright and cheery, and cleverly contain images of specific numbers important to Erdos' work, such as particular prime numbers or formulas or graphs. The characters are also based on portraits of real people with whom Erdos worked, so at the end of the book, as you read the detailed authors and illustrators' notes, you want to go back page by page and find who is who and what those numbers mean. This elevates the book to be used by older students as well as preschoolers. Bibliography is very short, because that's all that has been written about him. Author's note fills in details of his parents' lives and fleeing the Nazis in World War II. My favorite part (if I had to be forced to pick a favorite part) is the graph of ""Erdos numbers,"" showing a vast amount of people who worked with Erdos (so their Erdos Number is 1) or who worked with someone else who had worked with Erdos (therefore having an Erdos Number of 2). It was like Kevin Bacon's Six Degrees of Separation game, but with mathematicians and scientists!"

This reminded me of a Disney movie, with broad caricatures for characters (the main baddie could almost be Cruella deVil!) and witty dialogue, and narrow escapes. Lady Lamorna (that baddie I mentioned) is a sorceress who wants a new dress--a dress of black velvet with skulls and spiderwebs and spooky stuff on it. But after it's ordered she realizes she has no money! So, what's an evil witch to do? Why, cast some spells and do a little kidnapping and hatch an evil scheme, of course! She's really good at turning people into frogs, so... look out, princes of the five kingdoms. Meanwhile there's also a Cinderella-like story going on with our heroine Gracie Gillypot, who is rescued from her mean stepfather's dungeon by--a talking bat? Marlon is my favorite character in the book, but he's followed a close second by Gubble the befuddled troll who keeps literally losing his head. A quick funny goofy read. Suitable for grades 4-6."

If you too enjoyed those books, or your child does, then I think these books will be similar and contain the same enjoyment. I know it's a reader's sin to compare books, but it was the first thing I felt and it stayed with me for the entire read! 
 A hundred or so years ago, demons began attacking the outlying villages of Meridina. Their purpose is unknown, except that they steal the form of the living and leave them in an endless sleep. Whisperers, a special kind of magic folk, have the ability to banish the demons and restore the sleeping back to life. This story begins when people have fallen into complacency, believing the legends to be simply that. Of course, the Whisperers still exist, and this is the story of the rise of the demons once more and their quest to banish them. Interesting stuff! 
 I kind of felt like Alice and Dawn needed to be a little more distinct; they both are young, powerful and at a loss with their situation. I didn't really get much from either of them, although since they are so similar it would be cool if they were sisters or something. This was only a short book, great for children's attention spans but I finished it too quickly. Hopefully the rest in the series are available and go into more depth. 
 A fantasy packed with action that I'm sure most children would enjoy, and some adults as well. Four stars."

Paul Erdos was something, all right. A real ""character."" Typically, I've come to think about the mathematically centric as people who are very logically minded, people who love rules. As you learn on the second page, Erdos was anything but. 
 We don't get a tremendous amount of exposure to those who use math creatively. Most of our experience with math comes from math teachers, who are very often logic and very much rule centric. After reading Paul's story, I've come to rethink the way I see both mathematics and mathematicians. Which is precisely why this book is so important. It can reshape a kid's entire conception of a subject with many preconceptions. 
 As I flipped through the pages, I became more and more engrossed with Paul's character. Similarly to how Steve Sheinkin made Benedict Arnold and Robert Oppenheimer's character come to life by sharing a series anecdotes chosen with incredible care, Deborah Heiligman paints a brilliant picture of Erdos through poignant snippets of his life beyond math. In fact, a few weeks after I read the book I had a general sense of why we remember Erdos but it's the details of his character that I can vividly recount. 
 At 21 Erdos was already a world renowned mathematician. Invited to travel to England, Heiligman recounts an experience of looking at the bread, looking at the butter, and finally, grabbing the knife to make the attempt. After zooming in on that little experience, Heiligman takes the reader back out, giving us the bigger picture. Erdos realizes he doesn't quite fit into the world the regular way but being a guy who never liked to follow the rules, he invents his own. Paul never owned his own home, instead he traveled from city to city where a mathematician would take him in. They would cook for him, clean up the messes he made, and do his laundry and Paul would share the one thing he could- his mathematical mind. 
 Have you ever heard a kid explain what they did at the amusement park? You know how they just go on and on about every little detail- we rode this roller coaster, then we got cotton candy, then we played the ringtoss... That's exactly what I want to do right now. I want to just spill every single one of the anecdotes Heiligman included. But just like a kid talking about a fun park, I'd be telling you because I can't get over how cool they are, not because you even care to hear. 
 Paul Erdos was the Kanye West of mathematics. So extraordinarily gifted that people all over the world welcomed this very difficult person into their lives and accepted his faults because his talents so vastly outweighed them. 
 The Boy Who Loved Math has everything I'm looking for in picture book biography. It's distilled down to information and experiences that make me want to google this guy I've never heard of. But while the text is absolutely scintillating, remove the pictures and you'd miss out on soooo much original knowledge. Prime number theory imbedded into the chart the boy's drawing, geometry theory transposed over the landmarks of Budapest, puzzles Erdos and his friend worked on overlay the illustrations of their meetings. 
 But this story's piece de resistance: LeUyen Pham illustrator's note. The reader is taken through the book for a page by page explanation of all the details related to Erdos' life that have been inserted. While it's not totally uncommon to find a note about the artistic process the illustrator undertook, I've never seen anything as detailed. I sure hope this groundbreaking look into the complexity of creating high-quality illustrations for children's non-fiction picture books quickly becomes as common as an author's inclusion of their source notes. 
 My friends, we have a very special book on our hands here. A fascinating true story about an obscure character, superbly illustrated, with an artist's note that could very well advance the entire genre. Yeah. The Boy Who Loved is definitely a gem."

I have to be honest in saying that I just assumed Underpants equaled super crappy. I read this for my nephews and I think that it is definitely a goofy book, with a little gross out humor, but it was not as awful as anticipated. From a teaching standpoint, I do not like the comic sections because of the deliberately misspelled word, which is bad for kids learning how to read. However, I think that this will engage a group of kids who may not otherwise read. This is part 1 of a pair. It deals with the nerdy mortal enemy morphing himself into a booger monster and what entails as they try to solve the problem."

 If you know me well enough, you will know that Dr. Seuss is not my favorite children's author. I always had that feeling that there was a glass wall that stood between Dr. Seuss' tales and me as a child reader. I also disagree with how Read Across America only concentrates on Dr. Seuss when there are plenty of other children's book authors and children's books that deserve recognition for their quality and the activities that they can present. I will, however, say that I really enjoyed The Lorax and would consider it to be my favorite within his bibliography. I feel that with this tale, he does not just convey a tale intended for a younger audience, but a message that everyone of any age can come out feeling enlightened and informed. 
 The story begins in the present day, all run down on the ""Street of the Lifted Lorax"" that is covered in ""Grickle-grass"" where a boy (who is meant to represent the reader) pays a visit to the Once-ler, looking for answers as to why the Lorax was lifted away? Regardless of the opportunity, the Once-ler is always looking to make money and for a fee, is willing to tell the boy a story about the past, where creatures lived harmoniously and only took what they needed from the Truffula trees (such as its fruits). Once the Once-ler comes across these trees, he begins to see the profit he can make off of them and invents a multipurpose product called a ""Thneed,"" that can be used as clothing or furniture. The Once-ler is in turn questioned by the Lorax, who is a voice for the trees and a representative of nature, warning the Once-ler of the consequences that are bound to come with the rapid removal of the Truffula trees. After being constantly ignored, the area is faced with an ever so familiar crisis that is only bound to get worse, but at the same time there is a sense of hope that comes out of how one can respond to everything taking place within the text. 
 This book left a really strong message about the importance that our environment has not just on humanity, but for the rest of society and reminds us that we share it not just with other humans, but with other animals and living things. I get a kick out of how Dr. Seuss ridicules the great desire that humanity has for money, the great lengths they will go for profit and with no concern as to what they destroy in the process, and the use of ridiculous words to describe the means of destruction (such as ""smogulous smoke,"" ""Gluppity-Glupp,"" and ""Schloppity-Schlopp.""). That will definitely stick in my head for quite some time. 
 I took an environmental science class back in high school and it was quite memorable to the point that it has given me the awareness to do my very best in improving my habits regarding measures I can take to make the world a better place (especially when it comes to recycling, I became an advocate and a stickler for recycling). With books like this, one develops the tools they need to explore more environmentally friendly habits and perhaps even ways that they can make a profit while also not putting a great strain on the environment. There is a great ""seesaw effect"" between nature and the living creature's response to it, which includes the great weight that humanity places on it. By the end of the book, we have another tool that we can use to engage in habits that are healthier for the environment and, in turn, healthier for its inhabitants, ourselves included."

 The ending few chapters with the Queen was much more entertaining than any retelling (whether movie, game) I've ever seen; but other parts were disappointing compared to the legend that's become, such as the Cheshire cat. 
 That being said, I absolutely loved John Tenniel's illustrations, and the more entertaining of the conversations, and can't wait to read Through the Looking Glass."

The fact that there is still such great consistency in this series, despite the fact that it is written by more than one author, is amazing.

It is my favorite middle grade series that I have read in 2013. In fact, I think it might be better than Percy Jackson. 
 Substitute Creature was no exception. It might be my favorite book in the series so far. The cover is definitely the creepiest one. I love these covers, and how they change. I've never seen another cover do that, and pull it off as well as this series does. 
 I enjoyed this book the most out of the series. The reader gets to see a lot of character growth. Robert and Glenn become much more mature by the end of the book. Karina... well, she grows in her own way. I don't want to say anything that might spoil the book, but something amazing ends up happening to her. We see first loves start to form as well. 
 The illustrations are wonderfully drawn. They really help you to see a detailed version of what's happening in the book in your head. My favorite illustration is the one of Robert and Mac on top of the school roof, looking out at the city. It's beautiful. 
 I think Substitute Creature had the biggest cliffhanger of the series so far. We've been through all sorts of crazy cliffhangers in this series, but none of them compare to this one. I can't wait for the next book in the series to come out. I want to know what Robert's mom's reaction is to the information they gave her."

It's read at least half a dozen times a day and is the book of choice for bed time. I've found Joshua on the stairs, 'reading' it to himself having memorised much of the text which is very simple rhyming and captures and keeps his attention: 'Brown bear, brown bear, what do you see? I see a red bird looking at me'. We can talk about the picture and learn about the colour of the animals but often though, Joshi just can't wait to get on to the next page and so we keep the flow of the rhyming text going. 
 My 14 month old loves to listen along to my voice, smiling and laughing as the tone changes and then repeats. He also enjoys pointing and laughing at the pictures. I love Eric Carle's illustrations, which are large, very fun and brightly coloured. 
 Verdict: This is a really fun book. It's great for learning about different animals and colours, but we've also enjoyed the rhyming aspect and the fact that Joshua has been learning to 'read all myself' due to the simply written text.

Indeed, ""Waking Dragons"" is an adorable book, with wonderful illustrations by Derek Anderson and simple Seussian prose by Jane Yolen. 
 In truth, Yolen's prose is good but rather minimal. As a poem, it's a pretty straightforward five or six stanzas in abcb rhyme scheme: ""Dragons wake up,/Dragons rise./Dragons open dragon eyes..."" The draw is Anderson's colorful, bigger-than-life dragons. 
 There are two of them, a red one and a green one. As the story opens, a little boy dressed in a knight's suit of armor slowly creeps into a bedroom with his dog and climbs into a ginormous bed, where two dragons sleep. He gently nudges them awake; sleepy-eyed behemoths that yawn and put their pajamas in a hamper. 
 Then, the dragons brush their teeth and run downstairs where a plate of ginormous waffles await them. They quickly devour them, put on scarves and goggles, kiss the mommy dragon good-bye and the boy and the dragons fly off to knight school. 
 As story goes, it's pretty basic and not very substantial, but it's so damn cute, and my daughter loved it, so there's that..."

Today we're reviewing and hosting a giveaway for Teacher's Pest and Substitute Creature by Charles Gilman. These are Books #3 and #4 from his fun Tales from Lovecraft Middle School series that pays homage to author H.P. Lovecraft. You don't have to have read Book #1 or #2 to enjoy them. If you want a fun, creepy way to introduce kids (from about age 10 up) to weird fiction and the paranormal, this is a great way to do it. If you liked Goosebumps, you'll like these. 
 When the publisher sent these to me, I didn't expect to enjoy them that much as an adult but I loved them. They took me right back to what it was like to be in that awkward screwed-up place that middle school seems to be for most people. Didn't we all have teachers we thought had to be aliens, demons or zombies? One person is going to win both of these books in our giveaway, and it could be you, so be sure to enter!

He's an animal living in human society and he gets himself into trouble in the most ordinary human scenarios: shopping, at the beach, etc. My 11-year-old was disdainful at first, saying the book was just too young for him, but at the end, he was as hooked as my younger ones. We had our best laugh over the last chapter, and now we'll move on to the sequels. They're great bedtime reading."

Sam's baseball teammates, Joey and Roger, didn't want him to leave just yet (it's the play-offs and they had a really good chance this year!) so they plotted to get him to stay in a nearby cave till after the play-offs. 
 What did they find? 
 A chest with a dragon carving. A skeleton holding on to a map and a note about seeking revenge for a girl named Mei Ling. An earthquake. And much more. 
 The writing is good and the pace steady and quick. I especially like how the boys interact. This is an adventure middle-graders who are curious about Chinese dragons and who like a bit of mystery would love."

 Well, a creature called the Once-ler (you only see his green arms) comes to a verdant land of trees, fruit, and creatures, and begins chopping down trees to make his ""thneeds"", awful clothes made from the trees' tops. The Lorax appears to warn the Once-ler of the dangers of what he is doing but the Once-ler is making too much money to care. Soon all of trees are gone and so is the wildlife. This once thriving environment is now a desolate wasteland. 
 I think the message is a fine one - protect our forests! Stop de-logging the Amazon! (it's not really that specific but you get the idea). The only thing I was disappointed by was the Lorax himself (itself?). The Lorax doesn't seem to do anything other than wag his finger and then in the end he disappears. Hmm. Not much of a character is he? Just seems to be a walrus faced gopher who, instead of doing something positive, just seems to want to complain so he has the moral high ground. 
 Anyway, as with all Dr Seuss books it's got a fun rhyming scheme and a great message so that the book is enjoyable even for a grown-up like me. A kids' book with a conscience - just not a great main character."

After ruling the charts by being one of the most popular games, the Angry Birds has apparently made it to the world of comics through the hands of writer Paul Tobin and illustrator Isa Python. The comics presents the usual scenario of the birds being in constant clash with their arch enemies, the pigs who leave no stones unturned to steal their eggs. 
 The comics comprises of a number of short tales, where the birds and the pigs try to outsmart each other. The writer had a big responsibility of giving some kickass personalities to the popular faces and he has done so with flying colours. But where he had failed to create an impact is the plot. Most of the tales are pretty boring even for someone below 8 years of age. These are no where near the fairy tales that captured my heart as a kid. The author has portrayed the pigs as dumb creatures and at almost every encounter the birds come out as the winners, even without putting up a fight. There are no real twists, no signs of creativity in the storyline, clearly showing that the author had not given much thought before penning down the stories. 
 The artwork mostly fails to impress. The amount of light is wrong at certain places. The dead of the nights looks like dawn. Even the sky appears too dull for a bright sunny morning. 
 This comics might go well with die hard fans of the Angry Birds franchise but for real story lovers, this is a big no-no. Thanks to Netgalley and IDW Publishing for giving me an advanced copy."

 Little Argyle wants to play outside, but the strong wind keeps messing up his games, knocking down his fort, and blowing away his hat. He decides that he hates playing in the wind, and sulks indoors until his mother tells him to think carefully of something that would be good to play in the wind. Argyle thinks carefully and creatively to come up with the perfect solution! 
 Cute little Argyle!! So sweet!! He's full of imagination and really pours himself into his games. Reminds me of me when I was little; I was a very imaginative child who played lots of elaborate games of ""pretend"" with my siblings. Argyle plays pirates, dresses up like a spider, builds a castle fort, becomes a famous soccer star, and fights a dragon! I love this kid! 
 I love love love the illustrations. The soft colors and little details in the background make every page a delight! I had to stop and stare at each page for a little minute, to make sure I caught every sweet thing there. But it doesn't feel busy or overwhelming at all; it just gives the story more depth and interest. 
 When the wind comes whooshing in to ruin the game, I almost felt like I could feel the wind roaring and rushing by me. It reminded me so strongly of windy days on the mountain when I was a child, when the wind would tug at my hair and bring tears to my squinting eyes.

It is Katherine Rundell's second novel after her debut Girl Savage and was heavily influenced by her own night-time walks and adventures on the roof tops of Oxfords colleges whilst at university. The story opens beautifully, almost like a fairy-tale where a baby is found after a shipwreck floating in a cello case and wrapped in some manuscript. A gloriously eccentric but wonderfully kind man called Charles rescues her and brings her up as if she was his own child and she grows up as a fiercely independent and much loved little girl who knows her own mind from a very early age. 
 Unfortunately for Sophie and Charles the big wigs from Social Services don't quite see it the same way. Sophie is often dresssed very oddly which perturbs them slightly but not as much as when the social worker, Miss Eliot pays a visit and discovers that they write each other notes on the wallpaper. Not ""normal,"" or ""healthy"" in her books although I tend to agree with Charles when he informs Miss Eliot that: 
 ""On the contrary,"" said Charles. ""The more words in a house the better, Miss Eliot."" 
 Well said Charles! Miss Eliot however, has more to find fault with than just that and it is decided that Sophie must be taken away from a man that loves her dearly and whom she loves in return. Sophie has already been asking questions about her mother and she is determined that she is still alive and living in Paris, going by the label on the cello case where she was found as a baby. This gives Charles a marvellous opportunity to take Sophie and flee to Paris, where they hope to search for her mother. What Sophie is not expecting is to find a new life high up on the roof tops above the hustle and bustle of the capital with a courageous young boy called Matteo and his gang of orphaned children who may also be able to assist in finding her mother. 
 This is such a gem of a story that I think will appeal to adults as well as children and would be fantastic read aloud. I fell in love with Charles instantly and really enjoyed all his eccentric little ways, how he takes care of Sophie whist allowing her to be her own person and how he supports her without quarrel when she wants to find someone she has only dreamed about and who may be her only living blood relative. Katherine Rundell creates a magical world on the roof tops of Paris that will appeal to anyone with a sense of adventure and draws a strong character in her heroine Sophie that children will adore. I just know this book will become an instant classic that will continue to be enjoyed for years to come. Personally, I just can't wait to see what the author does next, I'm certain it's going to be great.

I was also surprised, since I had never read this, exactly how many references there are in the culture to episodes in this classic tale. Lewis Carroll occasionally steps back and uses his story to make some observations about the human condition that are engaging, but he doesn't use that much description, that much texture to really put you into the Wonderland world."

 I find myself doing the same with my own daughter now. 
 The Lorax was a book that I did not have as a young girl. I went out and bought it after the movie came out so that I could read it. 
 I fell in love with this book! (How could you not?) 
 I'm not much of an activist, but I do care about the environment a lot. 
 In Grade 7 science, my teacher used to say 
 ""Global warming and pollution issues do not seem important to you now, but one day your kids and grand kids will live in a very different world if we don't take care of it."" 
 This used to make me so sad. (I was always a bit of a softy) I want my kids and grand kids to see what I've seen and felt. So this book hit close to home. 
 Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not. 
 And cue the water works! 
 No matter how many Dr.Seuss books I've heard and read, no matter how many I know by heart, this is the one that stuck to my heart. I'll be remembering this book until I'm old and frail."

A retelling of some of the fables collected by anthropologist Wolfram Eberhard, so it's got some cred! Especially as the tales don't have an explicit moral - the reader is left to interpret it themselves. For older readers the moral will be an easy leap, although I'd be curious to know how younger readers would react to what might seem to be open-ended stories. But I'm really impressed that an English picture book would take this approach to Chinese tales. And the illustrations are good as well!"

I never read short stories, but for lack of anything else to read, here I am reviewing Unholy Cow. I definitely value humor in writing (and anywhere else) and Unholy Cow had me chuckling out loud in several places. I'm sure it was meant to be tongue-in-cheek, but there's a reason the story is only getting 2 stars from me. The writing is just not that good. Although the HUMOR in the story is OK, the writing style, the story and character development, and the ending leave much to be desired. This mostly made me think of the author as a kid who wrote a story for a high school assignment and decided to be a bit of a smart-ass about it. However, if this became something much more polished and elaborated upon, I would definitely consider purchasing a children's book about a demonic cow and her friends who live to cause mayhem. Good idea, bad execution."

One of the things that I liked about this series up to this point was the history that the kids learn through reading it. This book was severely lacking in any kind of educational value. I also enjoyed how international locations have been described giving kids a bigger picture of the world beyond there own little corner. Unfortunately, this book's description of Tokyo was a little too much in the style of a B-movie for me. As for the story, we get more of the same globtrotting, getting out of seemingly impossible situations within the same page of getting into them (how about a little suspense before making everything turn out ok?), and the added theme of teenage romance & betrayal that I was not crazy about. That being said, kids will enjoy the adventure and at this point are probably pretty invested in seeing what happens to Amy & Dan. I will read on because I'm a little invested in them too, but I hope the series improves."

This story begins by telling the reader that Mother's Day is coming and Mama just knows that Papa and the cubs are going to surprise her with a special celebration. Her hunch was that the cubs would serve her breakfast in bed and then, the rest of the day, she'd spend cleaning up the mess they had made during it's preparation. She isn't bitter though, she knows it's the thought that counts. The day before Mother's Day, Mama dug out and cleaned up a tray for the cubs to serve her and put it in a place they'd be able to find it. She also bought all the ingredients the cubs would need for her ""surprise"" breakfast and also bought some extra cleaning supplies for the aftermath. The morning of Mother's Day, Papa and the cubs sneck down to the kitchen before sunrise (but Mama watched out of the corner of her eye). Mama lays awake waiting to be surprised and has horrible thoughts about the mess that is being made in the kitchen. Mama's concerns came true when she entered the kitchen that morning. A bowl has broken, the toast has burned and honey is everywhere, but as she steals another peek, she can see a beautiful breakfast creation with flowers which are to be delivered to her in bed. Mama scurries back to bed just in time for Papa and the cubs to ""surprise"" her with breakfast in bed and a new bathrobe. Mama acts surprised and enjoys her French toast and tea. When Honey woke, Papa takes care of her to give Mama some time off and when Mama returns to the kitchen, she finds that Papa and the cubs have left it spotless! Mama exclaims that this has been the best surprise she has ever had. 
 The life lesson of this story is two-fold. First, sometimes it pays off for parents to let on that they're clueless about an upcoming surprise so their children can experience the excitement of preparing something nice for them. When Mama lets them surprise her, she winds up even more surprised when she finds that the cubs have cleaned up after themselves. Second, the cubs learn that they are appreciated and learn that a major part of making Mama happy is by just cleaning up after themselves."

The Grinch took all of the Christmas gifts and decorations up Mount Crumpit and waited to hear the crying from below in Who-ville as people woke up to empty houses.

 This review was reviewed as part of Amazon's Vine Program. 
 Longing to get my young daughters involved in music, I thought ACOUSTIC ROOSTER AND HIS BARNYARD BAND might be a fun way to approach the subject of Jazz music. Truth be told, I probably enjoyed the book as much as they did. 
 Oversized and full of vibrant and entertaining illustrations, ACOUSTIC ROOSTER AND HIS BARNYARD BAND is a simple story of a bass-playing rooster whose desire to be a star leads him to form a Jazz band comprised of other musically-inclined animals in order to compete in a talent show. The rooster's quest to recruit band members has him interacting with other Jazz-playing animals like ""Mules"" Davis, Ella ""Finchgerald"", ""Bee"" Holliday and ""Duck"" Ellington. The rhyming storyline is both fun and educational as each page introduces a barnyard version of a Jazz legend or an element of Jazz music. The hilarious, colorful illustrations complement the storyline perfectly and are sure to capture the attention of both child and adult alike. The end of the book includes a glossary of Jazz terminology as well as a brief entry on the real Jazz legends alluded to in the book. 
 I was more than impressed with every facet of this book ... the characters, the story and the graphics are superb and it was fun to read. This book gets a permanent place in the home library. I would love to a series of music genres covered by the same author and illustrator."

On each page there are Christmas items for children to count, the items are spelled out in nice black print (Christmas trees, snowmen, penguins, stars, etc.), there is the number printed out in letters and then there is also the number printed out in numerical format. That is what makes this a great book. Although this book only goes to the number ten, I love that it has everything included on each page. Children can see that eight means 8, that six means 6 and that nine means 9, the sooner they can learn these, the better. I love the black simple text that spell out each illustration, this also helps the child understand letter formation, that words are made up of letters and hopefully they will begin to recognize letters and sounds. These words might also become the child's sight words. The illustrations are bright and simple too. The hungry caterpillar makes his appearance on every page and on the last page like in his famous book; he is no longer a hungry caterpillar. What a great addition to your library.

It plays on the age-old trope of the witty small guy (the mouse) having a run-in with an animal (the weasel) who wants to eat him (the soup) and, of course, escaping. One wonders how predators ever survive in these worlds, since they never seem to get to eat anything. Anyway, the mouse pulls a Scheherezade-style gambit, offering the weasel stories that will make the soup more tasty, thereby deferring his fate. The four stories are an odd and eclectic mix: one parallels the mouse's situation, as it is itself a little folk tale about a mouse escaping from a crown of bees (and is in fact a play on fables such as the fox and the fleas, in which submersion drives the pests away--an inronic contrast on the mouse's soupy situation, perhaps); one is a whimsical tale about a mouse pestered by singing crickets; one is a parable about desire, in which two rocks wonder what's over the horizon; and one is an odd tale about a mouse with a thorn bush growing in her chair, which ends up sprouting roses. The weasel, being a literalist, believes the mouse when the mouse tells him that to flavour his soup with these stories he must add the things from them (notably never the mice, just the bees, mud, rocks, crickets and so on) to the tureen. When he goes out to gather them the mouse of course makes good his escape. It's a fun story, with interesting meta elements, and with vibrant, amusing illustrations."

The basic idea is bizarre and irrational-- bear emigrates as a stowaway from Peru to England (why? no real reason) and is adopted instantly into the Brown family, when they find him in Paddington station (why? no real reason). Nobody seems at all thrown by the fact of a bear wandering around in London, never mind the fact that he talks. Do other animals talk? Who knows? We never encounter any others. 
 Anyway, Paddington is basically a kid, getting in kid-like scrapes because of his naivete or his lack of motor skills. ONe particularly amusing sequence involves him staggering around blindly when he thinks he's in a dark room--because the hood of his duffel coat has fallen over his eyes, and he does not realize that that's why he is in the bark. What makes it work, I think, beyond Bond's light tone, is that Paddington is presented as an almost pure innocent (at times he seems a bit aware that he's doing something dodgy, but mostly he just doesn't understand). 
 This is light stuff--it lacks the deeper subtexts and resonances of the best children's literature--but it is nevertheless eminently enjoyable. Recommended. 
 Nice pictures, too."

It's the tale of a green creature who learns the true meaning of Christmas after years of isolation in a cave near the festive town of Whoville. The best part of the story is that his heart has the capacity to grow three times its size once he lets love and the spirit of Christmas into his life. His acts are forgiven by those he offended and everyone enjoys the holidays together.

 ...And I'm so glad I did! This is a fantastic fun-filled adventure that is going to appeal to so many of my students (and their parents and teachers, too!). Sam is a terrific character - smart without being annoying, willing to take risks without being obnoxious and a good, loyal friend. 
 The cast of the supporting characters (human and otherwise!) is rich and textured with terrific details. The mystery plot is fun and intriguing. 
 Really hoping for more fun from this group of characters!"

Not sure which it was, but in any case I missed Tim Curry as Mr Curry, because children's shows are usually dubbed around here. For some reason my heart is happy about the thought that Curry is in a Paddington TV show (at first I confused Mr Brown with Mr Curry, which is a shame, because I'd like to see Tim Curry adopt a bear). 
 Anywho, Paddington gets his name after London's Paddington Station, from where he's found by Mr and Mrs Brown. The bear from Peru loves marmalade and becomes known from his duffel coat and big hat. Well-meaning but clumsy, Paddington immediately starts to get into all sorts of situations. Among other things, he wanders around a tube station, goes shopping, visits the theatre, and makes a friend. Despite his tendency of getting into trouble, Paddington is very polite, but also doesn't accept poor treatment or what he interprets as poor treatment, reserving his icy stare for the culprit. 
 Classics of children's literature, the Paddington books are integral parts of British culture and therefore very British in nature. London exists very thinly in the background, with only a few mentions of landmarks and locations, but Bond has a knack for capturing the city, or maybe the country in a broader sense, with only a few strokes. 
 A Bear Called Paddington is cute and innocent fun, but doesn't underestimate its readers. Although I personally didn't fall in love with it (considering my usual taste in children's books, I didn't expect to either, but that's fine), it's nevertheless a classic that fully deserves that title. Paddington has a heart and soul that is the essence of children's literature. It's ""a pot of tea and a plate of hot, buttered toast"", a long Sunday morning in clean crispy sheets with the sun warming your face, and a bun and a cup of cocoa in a messy Portobello Road antique shop."

The book is written in rhyming verse and is very amusing and entertaining as are all of the Dr. Seuss books. Christmas is coming and the Who's of Who-ville are very excited about it. The Grinch, who lives in a cave in the mountains above Who-ville, does not like Chrismas and is very determined to ruin Christmas for the Who's. While the Who's are all enjoying Christmas Eve, putting up their Christmas stockings and decorating their Christmas trees, the Grinch is hatching an evil plan to stop Christmas from coming. The reason I love this story so much is that it demonstrates the real meaning of Christmas. Christmas is not about gifts and a big meal, it is about sharing happiness and joy with your family and friends. The Who's help to teach the Grinch about the meaning of Christmas and that you really can't stop it from coming, no matter what you do. I recommend this book for children from ages 3 to 7 if mom or dad is reading and from 7 upwards to read by themselves."

Although it was short, not giving the reader a ton of time to learn about the characters, they each still had such personality and depth. Innocent, adorable Lillian; little Dick; fiery, but sweet Stella; rambunctious, imaginative trouble-making Rees; mothering Maud; and Colin, the shepherd of the little group. 
 This story was very technically sound, without any typos or the like. The gospel message was woven so effortlessly and sweetly through the story. A great read for children of all ages! It would also make a great read-aloud. 
 I just love Amanda Tero's innocent, simple, stories. I needed a break from an action\adventure book I was reading, and this was just right! Tero writes with such simplistic beauty!"

 Rating: 4 / 5 
 Otogizoshi: The Fairy Tale Book of Dazai Osamu is a collection of four fairy tales written by renowned Japanese author, Dazai Osamu. In literary terms, this also falls into Japanese literature, and Japanese culture. 
 Otogizoshi is a collection of fairy tales that Dazai wrote during the last years of the Pacific War. 
 Despite the gloom and suicidal overtones of books such as No Longer Human and The Setting Sun, Dazai shows his wit and humour in this book and I'm welcome to a wonderful change from his works. Since reading Schoolgirl and Blue Bamboo, I just had to read this one as well. 
 Thanks to Scribd, I got to read this for free because of my 30 day free trial (please note a 30 day free trial only gives you three book credits and allows you to only read three full books). 
 The Stolen Wen 
 This is the story of an old man with a wen on his cheek, and how he cares and loves for it. His family have no care for him, and Ojii-san, a drunkard, needs a change of pace. This was a wonderful story. I really enjoyed it, after I got through Dazai's constant breaks of 'so I couldn't do this with this story because of this and that'. These were quite annoying, in all honesty, to read in the middle of the story. It was very distracting and it was hard to get back into it after having to trudge through it, especially when you're enjoying the story as much as I was. Dazai has a peculiar way of writing, and within his stories, this shows and it aids them. When he writes like this, I feel that, personally, it takes away from the story. It's not as smooth as usual, when he breaks the fourth wall, and as much as I love that in things such as Deadpool, I don't think fourth wall breaks works so well within this piece. I feel like I definitely could have enjoyed this a lot more than I did, had Dazai left out his narrations until the end. A shame, really. If this was a stand alone book, I would only give it 2.5 stars. 
 Urashima-San 
 What if Westerners were to get wind of this and run around claiming that Japan's fairy tales are more brutal or gruesome than their darling Greek myths? - Dazai, calling out the Whites. I love it. 
 I found this story to be quite educational, actually. Dazai teaches us of tortoises in a passage (in another author note, fourth wall break), and I found I didn't know of the things he wrote before reading this. 
 I wasn't enjoying this when I first started reading it. I found Dazai's constant annotations, as in the previous story, very off putting. However, as I continued reading into Dazai's writing in this, I became entranced, and ended up extremely glad I didn't DNF this book as a whole. The descriptions in this are just marvellous, and Dazai has created a remarkable fantasy land that I just wish to escape to and hole up for a while, despite the time limitation. This is a wonderful story that has just sparked my imagination in the most wonderful way. Reading this allowed me to adjust to Dazai's writing of annotations within his stories as well, and for that, I'm grateful as I can read freely without the interruptions. 
 This was a remarkable story and dissection of social standing and how humans view each other and the world. I found myself to be quite taken aback, realising that every word that Dazai wrote is true; it's how humans perceive and how we act. It was a bit down putting, really, to realise how much we do out of good practice that is really no good at all. This has definitely given me a new outlook on life, and many things to ponder on in my behaviour and to wonder if they're worth changing or not. 
 I have to say though - it was weird as hell learning all of this from a damn tortoise! 
 Click-Clack Mountain 
 I finally understand the fourth wall break! It's Dazai discussing the stories of the child's book he's using as a prompt for the whole story. That took me too long. 
 I really enjoyed this story actually. It's a story of too much revenge for one small act but I found it really sweet to read. It was evil, and definite overkill. The rabbit in this is wonderfully wicked, and I found I really enjoyed her character. She's a devious little minx and I couldn't help but feel a tiny bit of love for her. We're meant to feel sorry for the tanuki in this but honestly? I just wanted him gone. He annoyed me no end and I'm actually glad he got the ending he did. Whoops. 
 This was a brilliant story and Dazai did this wonders. 
 The Sparrow Who Lost Her Tongue 
 I cried reading this. I legit cried. I felt so bad for the sparrow, I just wanted to give her a hug. I think this was a really strong story about trusting the people you're supposed to love in the things they say, in my interpretation. The things that are said within this by one of the main characters really made me think about humankind and the way we do things. It's strange to learn these things through the way they have been taught but they have seriously made me think about the things that humans do in social standing and have really helped me to outlook on my own life. 
 Overall, I think this was a really sweet book. I really enjoyed reading it, despite it taking me too long to get through. I was put off, at first, by Dazai's constant authors notes, but when I reached ""Click-Clack Mountain"", I realised that he was, in fact, explaining his decisions and thoughts on the stories that he was rewriting from a children's book whilst stuck in a bomb shelter. I think this is pretty ingenious. It allows us a look into his mind as he writes, and allowed me, a foreigner, to understand the traditional children's tales a lot more. 
 This was a great little read, and I recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy and faerie tales."

2fd5fab5bdfeba75058b9c45ceb8d65f,20663731,9f5efde0f5670ae3d2608dfdf59d89c7,4,"There seem to be two chief reasons why people don't read the Alice books any more; or, to put it more accurately--as Martin Gardner does in his introduction--why only academics keep the stories alive. To be sure, the Alice legend, with all its glorious wordplay and idioms still in use in colloquial English today, is well known. But it is not much read. 
 The first reason is that it is simply a children's story full of puerile nonsense, and the second reason is that it is a drug trip with no real meaning (or perhaps too fertile for meaning). Both reasons are related and indicate why only academics continue actually reading the books. Today's reader will not get much out of reading the books and they cannot possibly compete with reading more acceptable of an adult (here I choose to refrain from examples). To be sure, there is much truth in this estimation. The books are in fact full of nonsense to the ignorant reader, of whom without these annotations, I would be one. 
 Lewis Carroll, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson's pseudonym, was an Oxford mathematician with a passion (probably platonic) for little girls. Alice Pleasance Liddell was to remain for Lewis Carroll what Beatrice was to Dante. (Fun fact: Dante's own masterwork, The Divine Comedy, began with the poet being led down a sort of rabbit hole and ended with his child-love Beatrice helping him ascend.) And because of the time (nineteenth century), locale (Oxford), the profession (math), and the subject/object of the book (Alice), many readers are bewildered by a book undoubtedly full of inside jokes, familiar in general to Oxford citizens of the time and to Alice Liddell in particular. 
 Therefore, in approaching the Alice books today, this edition, packed with Martin Gardner's stunning annotations, is arguably the only way to have a go at the text and walk away with a good experience. Otherwise one runs the risk of falling into the valley of lemmings content with chalking the whole story up to a drug trip (the white rabbit as cocaine and so on). Plus, as Gardner states in his introduction, he is careful to stave off from all-too-easy interpretations as the symbolic and the psychoanalytic. What we get are top-shelf pickings from virtually the entire corpus of Carroll scholarship, of which there is an exorbitant amount. 
 For me, I enjoy the second book, Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There, far more than the first. What's not to love, really? In this book, Carroll the mathematician shines. The narrative is built around a game of chess, with Alice as a white pawn working to advance to the other end of the board so as to become a queen. And all the while, pieces are moving around her, altering her experiences. Brilliant! In addition, the wordplay and Easter eggs (e.g. the closing poem is an acrostic using Alice's name) are taken up a notch from the previous book, giving way to a fruitful experience for any who enjoys a pun time and a good puzzle. 
 Looking-Glass is a sort of precursor to a Borges short story, in that it makes use of mirrors, chess, time, space, perspective, and so on. Carroll gives special attention to symmetry (mirror images: the real house versus the looking-glass house; Tweedle-dee versus Tweedle-dum; etc.) and parallax (apparent change in perspective due to movement of object relative to another object). These elements are akin to another nineteenth-century mathematician-writer, Edwin Abbott, in his monumental little book Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions. 
 I highly recommend reading this version of the Alice books, whether you've read the book or not. The introduction, annotations, and analysis make the story and legend come to life, without skewing your position one way or the other--that is, Gardner's sampling of criticism is wide and balanced. Don't fall prey to those who have heard so much about the book that they don't feel the need to create their own experience with it."

ed323fa9152da0f283867383a9a1aaa4,25020801,02cdf51db833d67a8ee69f015b42cb23,5,"A new series - children solving mysteries - gives some likeable characters working as a team to stop their friend from having to go back to Poland with his family. After his dad (a theatre security guard) is accused of stealing a big star's diamond necklace, Piotr is told they are moving back to their family's home country. 
 It is up to him and his friends, and some new ones they make, to solve the mystery and find the real thief... 
 The usual conventions are followed - false leads, questioning, clues, stakeouts and of course, a big finish and unveiling of the real jewel thief. 
 I liked having the book set in a theatre, lots of opportunities to talk about theatre convention (the Gods, backstage wardrobe, rehearsals). It worked well. The children are spunky and individualised, the suspects all questioned with clues here and there to tempt the reader to make guesses as to the direction to point the finger. 
 A good conclusion too, and a good series of different mysteries to solve with the same characters will be welcomed by fans of the first. 
 I liked it. I listened to the audio version, which was only 4 discs long, so this is a fairly quick read for a competent 8-12 year old reader."
ed323fa9152da0f283867383a9a1aaa4,13727169,6ba496eef4ae1c40ac1cca27e1fc3067,4,"This is a quite sweet little tale in the style of a Morpurgo animal-war-story, with shadows of both Robert Westall's Blitzcat and Sheila Burnord's The Incredible Journey. 
 For me as an adult, the standout element was the detail of World War Two England - an excellent teaching tool for inquisitive minds that all pick up trivia about bomb shelters, evacuation, blackouts, and life in general going into the Second World War. 
 As in The Incredible Journey, two dogs and a cat are 'left behind' by their beloved family (parents taking wartime jobs, children evacuated to the countryside). Though entrusted to a neighbour, circumstances lead them to run away and seek out the children they love, journeying around the country running into difficulties and working together to keep going. 
 There are side stories following the children in the country, showing what life was sometimes life for evacuees, and a touching plot about their grandmother suffering a breakdown remembering her son killed in the First World War. 
 There's nothing here child readers won't like - likeable children coping with adversity, brave animals and numerous scrapes. I did find it quite formulaic but this doesn't stop it being enjoyable. Blitzcat did the 'animals flit into various lives and change them for the better' plot. And The Incredible Journey had the animals feel more under threat. But The Great Escape contains lots of wonderful period detail and a neat little story with three animals who have distinct personalities and traits. 
 The afterword, giving details about the WWII facts on animals put to sleep is shocking and out me in mind of Morpurgo's regular comments on animal welfare in wartime. Good to know. 
 Quite exciting for a 9-year-old and so much to discuss with them to push an interest in animals and history."

 Surviving a shipwreck on her first birthday, Sophie is rescued and taken in by Charles, a single man who lives by his own rules. Growing up happily with his love and care, Sophie never gives up the belief that her mother, who she remembers to be a trouser-wearing, cello-playing musician, survived the shipwreck too. When social services threaten to take her away from Charles, they decide to try and track down Sophie's mother, meeting an interesting young roof-dweller along the way... 
 Charles and Sophie are adorable, their relationship warm and enviable. The story takes unexpected turns but is a lovely fairy tale with a strong female lead and lots of interest in its Parisian setting, on the roofs, even with a rooftop battle. 
 Deservedly shortlisted for awards, it's a little gem that should appeal to both genders."
ed323fa9152da0f283867383a9a1aaa4,2287256,426cb954ad44a58aadb852a3a1a00887,4,"I read this at around 8 or 9, I would guess. My son is working his way with me through our Dahl audio collection and since finishing this, keeps mentioning how clever Mr Fox is, and how horrible the farmers are. It has definitely hit a nerve with him, and he is just 5. 
 Chris O'Dowd narrates, and gives his Irish accent in variations to each of the animals, doing a rather suave Mr Fox and some loathsome farmers. 
 I was fairly shocked at the outright moral failings of Mr Fox, listening as an adult though - he DOES steal food and he IS in the wrong really. But of course, my son sees Mr Fox as a hero, as the other animals do. 
 We have three revolting farmers who live off of their own produce, and a family of foxes who take what they need to survive (despite living in a wood!), on whom the farmers voe vengeance - via shovels, diggers and guns... Can Mr Fox prevent his family from starving? 
 It's one of the shortest of Dahl's books, and does, when you're an adult, feel quite brief, though the plot is thorough and complete. I would have liked more to happen, more excitement and tense scenes between farmer and fox, but for a young child, it's a great little story of hero and villain. 
 You feel for the foxes, starving for days and then surrounded by plump chickens. And you also do loathe the repellent farmers. 
 We managed to listen to this in just a few sessions in the car, it was only 1 disc long and very nicely narrated. A great early Dahl to encourage children to try his longer books (we are now on The Witches!) and for those capable, to maybe try reading it for themselves with its 17 short chapters."
ed323fa9152da0f283867383a9a1aaa4,17415176,d7ddeaa670054ee5b9c36952dea51315,5,"My first re-read with my son. Via audiobook (David Walliams narrating), this captured me as much by Dahl's word-play as it ever did when I was a child. 
 My five-year-old loved it too and now keeps happily mentioned 'bellypoppers' at random times of the day. 
 This is arguably Dahl's best novel. Matilda is my favourite, but in no other book does he quite manage the amazing talent for language that he does with the Big Friendly Giant. 
 Sophie, the orphan girl, is snatched from her bed by a giant dream-blower, the BFG of the title, who lives in Giant Country as a runt among child-killing giants, alone with only repulsive snozcumbers for sustenance. And the dreams he collects to blow into children's windows at night. 
 The BFG is the father figure Sophie does not have, one with imperfect English (self-taught) who hates his fellow giants and their human-eating ways. It takes the little girl to conjure up the plan (involving dreams, a trip to London and the Queen of England) that will stop their evil ways for good. 
 What a lovely, lovely story to read together. With perfectly evil characters to despise, and a wonderfully heroic pair in little Sophie and her giant friend, you have the perfect set-up for a strong plot - where the story takes its time to get back to the killer giants. We have chapters meandering through the BFG's learning of English through books (always an important thing with Dahl), collecting dreams, looking at dream bottles, having giggles with whizzpops) until finally Sophie's plan must be acted on, and the Queen of England plays second fiddle to the twosome and helps them capture the child-killers for good. 
 My son didn't always understand the BFG's mistakes (in language), but I could see he was enjoying listening to the story, and was following the general plot. I'm sure as he grows older he will catch on and read this on another level. It was charming to listen to this as an adult and see the BFG as an overgrown child with no parental guidance, a good soul who tries to bring happiness to children but by himself is helpless to stop them. 
 Little Sophie is like Matilda in that she is the small person charged with defeating the mighty 'grown up' characters, calling in support, but providing the impetus needed to start events on their course. 
 Walliams voiced this very well, nothing overdone, appropriate and amusing voices for each character, the BFG given a quaint south-eastern farmer voice that doesn't become a stereotype, the Queen's closest to this but still amusing rather than annoying. 
 The Dahl everyone should read. And hopefully after this summer's (2016) film, it's the one everyone will be clamouring for copies of. Share it with them now. 
 One for all ages - if my 5-year-old can listen to 4 hours of the BFG, then anyone will love it."

Roman is another marvelous book in her newest series about Civilizations Throughout Time. Her first series introduced culture and customs to elementary age and younger children and with this series, she brings history to life for older students. Paula Tabor has drawn beautiful illustrations to show what life in the American West would have looked like in the19th Century. The author takes the reader briefly through a discussion of The Great Migration of 1843 and how people journeyed in covered wagons from the East to Oregon. With enchanting pictures and easy-to-read text, readers learn about the land that settlers were given, the building of homes and barns, and preparing the land for farming. The author touches on clothing, gardening, school and every-day chores. Included at the end is a glossary of words, with pronunciations, and also a section on the famous people from the American West. This is a wonderfully informative book about a slice of American history that is sure to capture a child's interest and imagination."

I loved the book. Even without the underlying message of being good to the environment it is a lovely and inventive story told in the beautiful and fun ""Seussish"" rhyme. All ages would love this book but I guess all ages don't agree with the message. There are people who think that the Earth is ours to use and that nothing is wrong with polluting it or otherwise destroying it. There is nothing that could make them like this book. Some people even dislike the rhyme that the book and all books by Dr. Seuss are written in. The Lorax is a fanciful creature whose message to save the trees is wonderful. 
 Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, 
 nothing is going to get better. It's not. 
 This will be my earth-day book for my classroom in the future and it is one of my favorites on my own bookshelf."

Readers will immediately feel sympathy or empathy for poor Spud and then anger at the resident bully, Candybar. Author Nancy Beaule, accompanied by the expressive illustrations by Lauren Goldstein (also illustrator of book 2, Search for the Hidden Treasure), does an excellent job of evoking emotions out of readers. 
 Also excellent are Beaule's descriptions. From lighthearted to embarrassed and frightening to safe, the moods of the characters and the tones of the settings are easily imagined. Her use of figurative language and short sentences will keep young readers engaged. Repeat readers may find a giggle (I did!) that Chompy the carrot eats carrot cake! (He's a cannibal! Ha!) 
 As with the prior books, the writing level is perfect for the intended audience (ages 4-8), and it will work well as a read-alone or read-aloud book. The parent in me isn't a fan of the word ""butt"" used several times, but kids will like it (especially if it's forbidden fruit for some). The Grammar Policewoman in me would definitely issue some tickets for some inconsistency and errors with punctuation, but it's likely readers won't notice them, and none will impact the enjoyment of the book. (But, oh happy day when a child notices a grammar rule broken!) 
 Colorful, fun, and funny, Chompy, Volume is a story I recommend for pure silly enjoyment. I look forward to the fourth book in the series, coming in the fall of 2017. Thank you to the author for providing me a free eBook in exchange for my honest opinion -- the only kind I give.

My review (the Mom). These are excerpts from the full review. To see the whole thing, visit us at www.motherdaughterbookreviews.com :) 
 DAUGHTER SAYS: 
 What I liked and disliked about it: I liked the funny, interesting names like Lorax and Once-ler. I liked the Truffula trees - they look like long stumps with hair. I didn't like that the Once-ler was cutting the trees because the trees were pretty. The end was good because the Once-ler learned his lesson and felt bad about cutting down the trees. I liked how the Once-ler used the word ""biggering"" to talk about how his Thneed company was growing. I felt sad when all the trees and animals were gone and I hope that with one seed, it can all come back. 
 I didn't like how the Once-ler was talking to the Lorax. I think I'm getting too old for Dr. Seuss books because the stories are too short; but I still like watching the movies. 
 My bottom line: I think littler kids like kindergarten kids and maybe kids in Grades 1 and 2 would like this book, but I still liked it. 
 SON SAYS: 
 What I liked and disliked about it: I really liked the Thneeds and how he made a whole shop of Thneeds - I really want a Thneed! I would use it as a pillow, or blanket, or a chair, or a couch, or a house, or as a rope to catch someone bad. I like how the Lorax just popped out of the tree stump, but he was bossy and mad. The Truffula trees were funny and cool. It didn't bother me that the trees were getting cut because it was making Thneeds and I liked how the Once-ler's stuff had the words ""Once-ler"" on it like his wagon and store. The Bar-ba-loots were funny with the way they climbed trees and ate berries. I liked how the city looked like when none of the Truffula trees were cut down. I also liked the telephone that the Once-ler dropped out of his house to talk to the little boy. I could use one of those to talk to my sister. I like the Once-ler's house and how you use ladders to get to another floor. I really like the cover and the drawings of the city. 
 I didn't like it when the Once-ler said ""Shut up!"" and when he called him ""stupid"". 
 My bottom line: I think every kid in my kindergarten class would LOVE this book. I can't wait to see the movie. 
 MOM SAYS: 
 What I liked and disliked about it: I thought I had read every Dr. Seuss book as a child. Well, I must admit that I don't remember reading the Lorax. Perhaps it might have gone right over my head (as may be somewhat evident by my kids' reviews - did my son REALLY say he wanted a Thneed!? Sigh...) I LOVED this book! As I was reading it, all I was thinking is that this is a simple story with such a strong message. 
 The illustrations of the Truffula trees and all the critters make you fall in love with this fantasy world. These images stand in stark contrast to the grey, drab, stripped-down environment pictured at the beginning and end of the book. The story effectively shows the deterioriation of the environment as the Once-ler gets greedier and greedier (love the use of the term ""biggering"" to describe his increasing greed). We turn pages to see less and less trees as the story progresses. We witness the migration of the Bar-ba-loots who rely on the berries of the Truffula tree. We are incredulous as the Once-ler turns a blind eye to the Swomee-Swans who cannot breathe with the smog created by the factory. We are saddened when the Humming-Fish must ""walk on their fins"" as their pond becomes inhabitable. But none of this compares to that final moment when the last Truffula tree is felled and the Lorax takes his leave. 
 But, thankfully we are not left hanging, Dr. Seuss delivers us hope at the very end. Oh, so well done!! Bravo, Dr. Seuss, bravo. 
 As mentioned above by my children, the Once-ler's treatment of the Lorax is pretty harsh and some of the language is quite strong. However, compared to the dialogue that occurs in real life between greedy corporations and environmental groups, I find this language quite tame and relatively respectful. Ok, it's quite disrespectful, but the idea is that the Once-ler is the villain so it just makes him that much more so when he's mean to that poor little Lorax. 
 My bottom line: I was pleasantly surprised by this book, but I'm a bit perplexed by what I should say for a recommendation. The message of the book clearly went over my pro-Thneed son's five-year old head, but my eight year-old daughter felt that the book was a bit too simple for her. I LOVED it. I will recommend this book for 3 to 7 year olds but be prepared to really discuss the message in the book - - otherwise you may find yourself trolling ebay for a ""Thneed""."

My parents bought the book, and my father read it to me several times, usually as punishment. Confidentially, I actually found the story of this outcast young boy, bullied and ostracized by adults and other kids at his elementary school because of his bizarre vocal talent, sad and a bit scary. It was not at the top of my ""Read me a Story"" list (even though I could read). But I digress... 
 The book is attributed to Dr. Seuss, but it emerged from a screen play written by Suess/Giesel and P.D. Eastman, author of ""Go Dog Go"" and other Beginner Books. It's the classic story of a child with a strange affliction that frustrates his parents, stymies doctors and provokes teasing and exclusion by his classmates. The illustration of three of Gerald's peers all pointing ""down the road"" with a fierce, ""beat it, weirdo!"" look on their faces is an iconic representation of tribal rejection. As in all of these types of stories, the outcast performs an heroic feat that earns him acceptance and readmission into the society from which he was unceremoniouly shown the door, and a career in media. One has to wonder what kind of dating life Gerald enjoyed after reaching ""that age"" with a name and a vocabulary wherein ""boing-boing"" was prominently featured. But that's another story, and I digress again... 
 When I read this book to my children, my son, who is totally blind, enjoyed it, but my daughter did not. My edition of the book is from childhood and has Scotch tape holding it together, and crayon marks on numerous pages, courtesy of my younger brother. So the presentation wasn't exactly that inviting. 
 My suspicion is that this story was the inspiration for Seuss's ""Mr. Brown Can Moo, Can You?"" another story of astounding vocal talents, but featuring an older man, no drama and no suggestion that Mr. Brown's childhood was anything but ""moo-valous""."

 Hey, who hasn't had this problem? My daughter can lose something on the journey from the kitchen to the living room, which is about two steps away. 
 Davey enlists a side kick in his very bubbly, talkative bird friend, Sarah, who I admit is my favorite character in this children's story. Sorry, Davey. 
 They investigate along and do what kids normally do, accusing the wrong people and 'ruffling feathers' along the way. Sarah keeps Davey honest though and proves the moral of the story (Watson always had a lesson or two for Holmes, didn't he?), which is to think before accusing, which is a good lesson. And appropriate for the 5 year old crowd. 
 The story is filled with great characters like Sarah, Davey, and the Squirrel. His characterization made me smile. The illustrations are simple, bu beautiful just as they were in Honey the Hero, one of my daughter's new favorites. The language was easy to read, but as another reviewer said probably for an advanced little reader. Still the text is short enough that it'd make a great bed time story for a parent to read to their child. Or challenge the child and they can come to you when they can't figure out a particular word. 
 Sherlock Holmes is great and the earlier we can introduce his concepts to kids and get them on the gravy train--the better."

 Like all of his stories, the key strength of How the Grinch Stole Christmas is his use of language and rhyme. In his typical 'Seussical' style the author manages to engage the imagination and attract the attention of his young readers, and his lively manner enables extracts to be acted out by a class. 
 Furthermore the character of the Grinch himself can be used effectively in a classroom environment. His transition from a selfish greedy character into someone who is both kinder and warmer contains echoes of Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol'. The children could be asked to think about why it's better to act more like the Grinch at the end of the story than the mean spirited miser from the beginning. 
 Overall this is an excellent short story which can be used cross curricula in a variety of ways: 
 In literacy, children can look at the rhyming structure and interesting vocabulary to write their own addition to the story in the signature style of Dr Seuss. It can also be studied in PHSE/behaviour management where the actions and moral journey of the Grinch can be discussed in a group setting. The importance of Christmas beyond material goods can be discussed, as well as other festivals/religious holidays that can be viewed with similar importance."

It's so old fashioned to read now, it was quite funny. Her way of putting (and repeating) things is a little condescending though. I felt She was aiming her words at slightly more privileged kids (maybe not deliberate, perhaps it's just because that's all she knew of life), rather than the general population. It all felt a little false I guess. I found out she likes gardening and animals. The biggest surprise revelation was that her parents wanted her to be a musician, and that's the path she was originally going down. What in earth would children have grown up reading if she had! I also didn't know she write Christian story books too. I also thought - as a child - I'd read all she had to offer, but I can see I got no where near. Interesting.

 Recently my granddaughters visited, and when they saw that I had a copy of Library Lion, they were positively ecstatic. They were quite familiar with the book since it is one they have checked out repeatedly from their local library in Virginia. Needless-to-say, it was read several times during their visit with Grandmama. 
 What is the draw of this book? What is its charm? Why is it a winner of a plethora of awards? 
 The library is a very special place and has rules. Miss Merriweather is the librarian and she makes certain that folks obey the rules. One day a lion walks into the library. No rule against a lion in the library. The lion goes to story time. No rule against that. 
 As time goes by, the lion visits earlier and earlier and becomes Miss Merriweather's library helper. And one day she falls off her stepladder. Oh my! Now a rule must be broken. 
 This gentle story about the lovely library and the gentle giant of a lion is sweet and endearing. It gently teaches that rules are important. Yet it also teaches that there are circumstances where we must make a decision to break a rule. 
 Beautifully drawn illustrations capture the essence of the story. Together the words and pictures create a story that a child wants to hear again and again.

 Owly e un simpatico e tenero gufetto, tondo e tutto occhi, protagonista di queste tavole di sole figure. 
 Il fatto di non avere dialogo, nulla toglie alla vivacita delle storie, anzi. 
 I disegni sono molto espressivi e ricchi di dettagli, benche realizzati a larghe pennellate bianche e nere, il ""dialogo"" avviene attraverso immagini che simboleggiano concetti e idee. 
 I libri si leggono velocemente, senza dubbio, ma non si puo non rimanere affascinati dalla schiettezza del messaggio che le storie vogliono trasmettere. 
 Owly e un personaggio attento, coscienzioso, attento verso gli altri e che fatica a farsi degli amici. Tuttavia, dopo le prime esitazioni, non desistera di fronte alle difficolta e riuscira man mano sia ad avere nuovi e fidati amici, sia a dare una mano agli altri. 
 Le tematiche toccate sono tante, semplici ma importanti: l'amicizia, la cura del prossimo, la forza per superare le difficolta, i pregiudizi, il fare del bene disinteressatamente. 
 Attraverso exempla coinvolgenti e l'empatia che non si puo non provare per il piccolo Owly, si trasmettono valori fondamentali al lettore. 
 Sfogliare queste tavole, anche per gli adulti, e tornare un po' fanciulli, riscaldare il cuore con qualcosa di semplice ma essenziale, lasciarsi strappare un sorriso ricordando quanto sono fondamentali le cose ei gesti piccoli ma sinceri.

Leaf Man is available in a hardcover edition with glossy printed pages, each scalloped on the top to create a layered effect within the book. 
 Leaf man has landed in your yard, that's right, look carefully and you will see the outline of a little man in the leaves. His body is a bright maple leaf and his hat is an acorn, do you see him now? Yes, that's right; it is just like looking for shapes in the clouds. Each page tells an adventure of the leaves creating movement and shapes out of nature. The story is very simple, but the story is more than beautiful with the collages and your imagination. 
 Not only is Leaf Man a beautiful book, it's the perfect jumping off point for exploring nature and creating your own nature crafts. Elhert simply introduces how delicate leave can set the scene for anything, just add imagination. I plan to re-read this with my Lil Guy and go on a leaf hunt in our own yard. The leafs guys we create will be so much fun! This book would be perfect for all children who like nature, like to create, and like to imagine. (That's all children, right?)"

How I want to watch these two continue to grow into adults, watch them fall in love, watch how they continue to deal with all the best and worst part of life? 
 This book is a beautiful story about a young girl dealing with tragedy and being swept along on a magical adventure that helps her hold tightly to her memories and look to the future while letting go of her past. It is this amazingly complicated story that is told through beautiful imagery, a wild adventure, and loving words. 
 I loved the suspense in Molly Pepper and the Night Train, this feeling like at any minute Molly and Noah who are being lead on this crazy adventure are going to get into a sticky situation....but the best part for me as an adult and mom is knowing that the way Courtney King Walker has written the tale I don't have to worry about my young reader, because it's clear that even though to Molly this feels like a secret (and at times scary) outing she is always being watched, always being cared for. I loved knowing that if she ever fell apart Molly's family are waiting there to catch her, but yet they let her take this exciting moment and run with it. They let both her and Noah find their own strengths and weaknesses. In a time when we have become a society that hovers over our children it is refreshing to read a book about children being able to take on the world on their own, but always with the safety net in case they need it.

 After a ship wreck leaves Sophie floating in a cello case a kind man, Charles, adopts and cares for her. Slightly eccentric himself Sophie learns about anything and everything including how to play the cello and button shirts. Authorities don't agree with her trouser wearing ways and decide that she needs to be taken from Charles... this is where her adventure on the roof tops begins! 
 I thought that Charles and Sophie were adorable, perhaps the relationships are a bit saccharin but I really enjoyed that! There are a host of other young characters to love and older characters to loathe which helps to transport you into this childlike world or innocence, wonder and friendship. 
 Brilliant for young readers but also thoroughly enjoyable for grown ups too."

 Written in 1924, this little recollection of life in the old country (which appears to be Russia) is a very simple collection of eight stories, each connecting to the previous story. 
 There is Auntie Katushka, 
 who has come from the old country so she can visit her little nephew, Andrewshek, who doesn't always listen and has a proclivity for getting into trouble. 
 The local farm animals are always getting into the picture, including the Green Goose, who loves his poppy seed cakes a bit too much. 
 The author, Margery Clark, was actually a composite of two librarians, both of whom wrote children's books. The text is easy for children and dare I say, fun. The technicolor woodcuts are by Maud and Miska Petersham, which are delightful for very young eyes. While I enjoyed this, it's best for nursery age children, who will delight in repeating the names over and over. 
 I must admit that I completed this quickly but then looked at it again, just for the simple fun to be had with the old country.

In this story, Davey finds a paperclip and hides it in his nest right before bed. This is a characteristic of certain birds where they hoard shiny objects. When Davey wakes up, he digs through his nest for his treasure only to find it missing. Instead of calmly looking for it he decides that his treasure must have been stolen. He uses this as an opportunity to become a detective, something he has always dreamed of doing. He acquires a sidekick and goes in search of his lost paperclip. During his adventure, they accuse a completely innocent deer of being a thief without any real evidence. They also assume a squirrel is guilty and sneak into his home at night, destroying his stacks of nuts and scaring him in his sleep. The result of these assumptions is that Davey's sidekick finds his paperclip in Davey's nest right where he left it. You may be wondering what lesson a kid might learn from this story. I see a couple of lessons here. When you assume you make...Oh you probably know the rest of that one. Never trespass. Never accuse someone of something you aren't certain they did. The end of the story tells us that Davey learns the value of a real friend as well. Of course if you haven't read a Bird Brain book before, you really need to check out the art. The illustrations are always cute and sometimes humorous as well."

This was the first time I'd read the Goblin and the Grocer, and it was stunning. The illustrations are perfect-- magical, eerie and heart warming all at once. I highly recommend pairing this with episodes of the Danish TV series The Fairytaler, because not only are they animated and fun to watch, but stick pretty closely to Andersen's original tales, unlike many of the other movies we've seen. The best part of reading the true versions of these fairy tales to my boys was to see the emotional connection they made with each story. The Little Mermaid and The Snow Queen, for example, no longer exists in their minds as a soft princess stories for little girls, but as an imaginative, deadly adventures that peak into heaven and stare down difficult morals. This is what Einstein meant when he said, ""If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairy tales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairy tales."" These are the tales our children should know."

The art is simple, and stories are playful and fun. Though many are silly, they also contain important lessons, such as being prepared, being practical, and just making things work in all times. 
 I have two favorite tales in this collection. The first is the very first tale, The Practical Bride, in which her bridal carriage breaks. Not knowing what to do, she simply runs along with the bearers to her wedding, and not a single bell is out of place in her hair. My second favorite is the story of Sakyamuni and Lao-Tse, in which two statues calmly converse in peace about Buddhism and the Tao, and then their followers come along and keep moving them to different shelves, and they are no longer in peace and have to keep shouting at each other. These tales are fresh, simple, clean, and bright, and great short exercises to get children's imagination's going and connecting with another culture."

After trying out a multitude of things (that feel too many for him) to play outside on a windy day, Argyle Fox has decided he does not want to play outside anyways. But his mom's quiet suggestion to think a little harder prompted him to, well, think; and he came up with the perfect solution to enjoy the windy day outside, and have his friends enjoy with what he played with too!! The pictures play their part in the telling of the story too as the wind plays havoc with each of Argyle's creative ideas to play outside, until his final 'eureka' moment. 
 This is a great read-aloud book where you could possibly enact the scenes either indoors or outdoors to make it a great fun read for young readers.

They captured my imagination, and in a fit of nostalgia that's the internet's fault, I decided to track down the books again. 
 Going back to them, I found myself realizing how much they were written for children. Not that this is a bad thing -- there is just this rhythm to the words, the use of numbers and alliteration, and the silly names, that gives the feeling that the book should be read out loud. 
 Another thing I noticed were the illustrations. They're lovely, black and white and charming, and look like they were drawn with soft pencil lines. I can't remember if the books used to be in colour -- I certainly remember the stories being more colourful, but perhaps that was just because I had a better imagination back then. 
 The casual violence in these stories startled me, the mentions of beatings and lashings, but maybe that was just a result of the time in which they were written. Or the time they're supposed to take place in, before electric stoves but after trains. 
 Still, it was lovely to revisit the stories, and to have them collected together so nicely. I am very glad they decided to celebrate the stories' fifth anniversary by releasing this lovely edition."

 ""Perhaps if you think for a while, you will figure out something to play in the wind,""said Mama Fox. 
 A beautiful picture book with a charming message. 
 Loved the style of the illustrations, with every page full of hidden details the longer you look. 
 I have a soft spot for foxes anyway, but really enjoyed the character of Argyle and the way his mother challenged him to find new activities, rather than just giving him an answer or attempting to entertain him. This is a really important message for children (and their parents) as so many of the children I work with now have every minute timetabled for them and struggle to entertain themselves. Yet, it is sometimes during a period of 'boredom' that creativity flourishes. 
 I received an ebook review copy through Netgalley and, after reading, immediately went on Amazon to order my own real copy. Unfortunately, it's quite pricey, but it is a beautiful book! I am now looking out for other releases from this author-illustrator and am trying to get my hands on a copy of The Mice of Bistrot des Sept Freres, which also looks brilliant. 
 What I liked: The message for children about creativity and perseverance, the detailed illustrations 
 Even better if: It became a series! I would love a sequel with more of Argyle's adventures.

 IT'S NOT TOO LATE!!! 
 UNLESS someone like you. 
 cares a whole awful lot, 
 nothing is going to get better. 
 It's not. 
 This is one other of the best ever tales by Dr. Seuss. 
 Like, The Sneetches was crafted in the 60s, it's not wonder that The Lorax was conceived in 1971, since it was the decade where ecology finally became a relevant issue in the conscience of people. 
 A powerful story showing in a very open way, how grimm will be our future (and sadly, forty-five years later, we are still in the same trouble) if we let that our woods would be lost without control at the expense of making stuff that we really don't need or that we'd be able to supply in other ways. 
 But it's not too late yet!!! 
 If each of us, make our contribution in one way or another, not matter how small, we still being able to help our planet's nature, and then... 
 ...the Lorax will return!"

 HOW THE GRINCH STOLE OUR HEARTS AND SOULS 
 It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right. 
 It could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight, 
 But I think that the most likely reason of all 
 May have been that his heart was too sizes too small, 
 Okay, people, this is it! 
 This is my favorite tale by Dr. Seuss, and I am quite certain that it must be the most popular and known of his works. 
 We are in Who-ville again and The Grinch is up to no good with mischievious plans to steal Christmas from there. 
 But you can't steal something that really is immaterial. 
 The very word ""Grinch"" has been added to our common talk in Christmas' season, as a true testament of the real impact of Dr. Seuss' work in our popular world culture. 
 One of the strongest message by Dr. Seuss remembering us that Christmas isn't in a store, it isn't something that you receive, but it's something in your heart and soul that you happily give to others."

However after watching the film Saving Mr. Banks I became curious to read the book from where it all began and to see this more cantankerous Mary in action. 
 The book is basically a series of mostly unrelated vignettes with, more or less, each chapter being a different adventure. A few of the chapters, probably a little less than half, are the basis for the musical film. She still gives her spoon full of sugar (though without uttering the lines from the song; instead she's rather snappy about it). She still visits Bert and goes into the drawing (though without uttering any 34-letter words... and without the children). 
 Besides the most famous parts I honestly don't remember the film all too well it being so many years since I watched it, but I think I do prefer the book. The film, despite its London setting, is infused with a very colourful 1960's wholesome Americana flavour but the book is all early 20th century Britain. 
 Mary herself is a very interesting character in the book, and I can see why Walt Disney was so taken by her. She is a very singular creation. In today's terms, imagine someone with a mystical new-agey sort of naturalistic magic but who comes off more like Margaret Thatcher on a bad day. That's Mary Poppins. She's vain and she's cranky and the dictionary has her picture as the definition for 'stiff upper lip', but like the Grinch you do get the impression that, deep down somewhere or another, she does have a feeling or two tucked away. The children, though unsure what to make of her at first, eventually learn to love her despite her quirks. 
 Some chapters were better than others, but I think my favourite was the bittersweet one with the two younger children, the twin babies. Though they'd only been props for most of the book, in this chapter when the older children are gone we find out that the babies talk just like the rest of us but we can't understand them, except for Mary Poppins who does. A starling bird comes to chat and though they all laugh about how anyone older than a year or so, Mary being the exception, can't talk to animals or understand the wind and such, the starling warns that the babies will have the same fate soon. They vigorously protest. At the end of the chapter, some months later, the starling returns for another chat and finds the twins don't understand him anymore. 
 I listened to the audiobook narrated by Sophie Thompson. She did a really great job of narrating; her different voices for different characters were especially spectacular (I think her version of Mary's uncle was my favourite). I thought perhaps she went a tiny bit too fast considering children would be a large part of this audiobook's audience but all around one of the best narrators I've heard."

 Monster hunting never goes out of style and our protagonist isn't a Mary Sue, but a girl struggling with growing up, coming into her own, and setting priorities. Basically, Kelly's a normal girl her age. The secondary characters are also unique with their own backgrounds, personalities, and motivations. 
 The only criticism I have is I wish it was a little longer and that the author spent more time on details. For example, there's parts in the story where you wonder how one character got from one spot to the next or what exactly the room they are in looks like, etc. 
 I will be picking up the next book in the series when it comes out."

After that the laughs came thick and fast. 
 My only gripe is that: Why does the main characters best friend always have to be an insufferable jerk? (if you have read The Strange Case of Origami Yoda and the rest of that series you know what I mean)"

 This creatively written book teaches many valuable lessons. A look at how stealing effects others. You can do with less and be happy if you have a support system. ""What if Christmas... perhaps... means a little bit more...?"" 
 Dr Suess expressive words are memorable. ""Your brain is full of spiders, you have garlic in your soul."" The Grinch was much less frightening when his heart grew three sizes. Up until then, he was downright scary. 
 The coming together of family and community at Christmas time is one of my favorite Christmas illustrations and Walter Matthua's audible version is outstanding."

The pace of the narrative is good, and the local setting works. It is well written with genuine excitement and tension. It does feel a little dated but overall I think it deserves its place as a kiwi classic."

Substitute Creature is as good as, if not better than the previous books in the series. My daughters have both loved reading the series. Robert is the hero and this time he is saving his mother and class mates from being eaten by the Old Ones. 
 This didn't let us down at all. The main characters are growing up in front of our very eyes, having read all of the series you will notice this. 
 The book cover is fantastic and certainly a selling point directed at children. It's creepy but not enough to cause bad nightmares and full of adventure. 
 It was well written and the illustration is brilliant. I have a 7 and 16 year old and they have both read it cover to cover and asked if there will be another book."

The Last List Blog Hop is an effort to support the authors and their books on the last Egmont USA list. By the way, if you want to join in on this blog hop, sign ups are open until 12pm EST, March 1st. I read an e-ARC of this title from Netgalley. 
 Dean Seaborne is kicked off his ship by One-Eyed Jack, the vicious Pirate King, with one last chance to prove himself. Dean's mission is to see if Gentlemen Jim Harper, a rival pirate captain, is skimming any treasure off the top of the booty they've pirated that's meant to be tribute for One-Eyed Jack. And, Dean is also supposed to find the gold from the legendary and mysterious island of Zenhala, a place Dean doesn't believe actually exists, once he gets himself fully wormed into Gentlemen Jim's Pirate Youth crew. However, once they do stumble upon the island, Dean realizes the island inhabitants believe him to be the lost prince, who was kidnapped as a baby by pirates thirteen years ago. Although, Deans knows he's no prince, but he has no choice but to fulfill One-Eyed Jack's mission. Dean is pushed by the islanders into undergoing intense trials to prove his lineage as prince, but the longer Dean stays the more he begins to question his mission. 
 This middle-grade adventure is an incredibly fun and fast-paced story. Dean is a great leading character and is immensely likable right from the get-go. I loved to hate One-Eyed Jack, the ruthless Pirate King. Gentlemen Jim, although a pirate captain, is actually quite likable as he's not the same kind of pirate as One-Eyed Jack. Everyone is clearly fleshed out with a back story and motive for their actions. As for the plot itself, it's quite solid and it has a few really good twists that really kept me turning the pages. The descriptions are quite vivid and the auther does a fantastic job of showing instead of telling, from ships to islands we get a good look at them. The action scenes are also well-done and it's easy to get a sense of exactly what's going on when. I could easily see this being adapted for the big screen. I'm eagerly awaiting Seaborne #2! 
 If you like The Pirates of the Caribbean, The False Prince by Jennifer A. Nielsen, Robin Hood, Peter and the Starcatchers by Dave Barry, and The Lightning Thief by Rick Riordan, you will love Seaborne #1: The Lost Prince by Matt Myklusch."

 It introduces mythological creatures while using lively rhyming text, like this bit about a unicorn: ""We'd prance through fields of posies and nibble nectarines/I'd shine her horn with candy corn to get a starry sheen.""

 Paul was such a quirky boy and man, and my kids loved the attitude of his mother and the whole way the book was told. 
 The art is darling, the story is darling, and it teaches a great lesson about people who are different who can craft lives that accommodate their talents and quirks. This is one of our favorite books (and we have thousands of books)."

 So, naturally, she was going to have an extraordinary life. 
 She goes to live with scholar Charles Maxim, who knows nothing about raising children but everything about giving someone love and confidence and a general lack of decorum. This would be fine except for the fact that Children's Services decides that Sophie would do much better at an orphanage. So they run off to Paris to find her mother and meet marvelous kids called ""rooftoppers"" along the way. 
 Except for the rather sudden denouement, this was gorgeous and delightful.

The panels are surrounded in black instead of white - and most panels take up the full two page spread. The illustrations are simple and colorful. There are three good friends - and three short chapters! In the first chapter, Little Duck, Big Duck, and Porcupine decide to have a picnic. What to do when it rains?! Chapter 2 finds Big Duck sure he is forgetting something important. Little Duck tries to give him hints and, in the end, Big Duck remembers that it is Porcupine's birthday! And last, but certainly not least, Big Duck suggests camping! And you can never be TOO prepared on a camping trip! 
 I think these will be very popular in the transitional reading section and also could be used as part of a smaller storytime. The illustrations are bright but the book is the size of a normal reader - so it might be hard to see if there was a large group!"

Most of the children's ebooks I have seen have horrible illustrations, but the illustrations in this book were simple yet very professional and entertaining. The story flowed nicely and my son (6 years old ) read it to me. It had a very heart touching ending which I wish could be hinted at in the title, without ruining. My son laughed with me throughout the book. To me that is a good book. A book that both entertains & interests the child, and it is always a bonus if the story also gives them something to fill good about. I am a graphic designer and illustrator myself, and I loved the illustrations. Very touching, funny, & awesome story!"

 As the voice of the trees, the Lorax acts as protector of the forest. 
 The ""I"" in this book came from the Once-Ler, who can be as well be defined as the factory foundries, industrial beings which produced nothing but toxic wastes to keep their profit running. The effects it caused--and the stubbornness of men rings painfully true. People won't hear anything as long as they got what they wanted. They don't care about anything surrounds them, as long they got something. This is a perfect example of human's greed. 
 This book is a message to all of us that in order to protect the nature, we are the one cause who can make it happen. It is we ourselves that the Lorax is trying to save, by giving us the most important lecture that our forest needs saving, that as long as we could preserve it, the world would be a better place. 
 Though it was a children's book, but it somehow resonates a common secrecy that eventually leaking out, loud and clear. Perhaps this was the reason which inspires so many environmental activists out there. Great book."

What will happen to the presidential election? I guess you'll just have to read Fake Mustache... 
 What I thought about it: 
 Fake Mustache was a great book. I like mustaches, so this was the book for me. I saw the word mustache and Tom Angleberger, and said ""Why don't I check it out?"" It was the first Tom Angleberger book I read, and I will definitely read more of his books. I have heard many great things about him so I checked it out. I love the little ""unheard of"" twist Angleberger put on this book. I mean, you usually don't hear about kids spending $200 on a fake mustache for a plan to become president. Or boys dressing up as cowgirl-Tv stars. While you're reading this book, You just hate Fako more everytime you hear his name. Also, quite a bit of suspense. And wanting a sequel. Overall, a book worthy of a golden mustache. So, if you want to find out if the presidential election gets sabotaged, read this book! More reviews at www.mybookwormblog.wordpress.com"

 The simple font of the clear text is space appropriately and easy to read. 
 One of my favorite pages is when Argyle just sits and thinks (and does yoga!) as I'm always telling my students how important it is to just sit and think sometimes! 
 I also love the last page,which is also an invitation to stop and think - this time how considerate Argyle was of his friends to make kites that seem very personal!"

The message of the story can speak to both adults and children alike and is definitely one of my favourites. 
 The Wemmicks are small wooden people who every day give each other stickers. The good looking or talented Wemmicks receive gold stars while those whose wood is rough or chipped or who can't do much get grey dots. Punchinello always tried to get gold stars but always seemed to fall and mess up and ended up covered in dots. When he meets Lucia he is amazed that she has no stars or dots on her. She introduces him to Eli the maker and he begins to realise that things could be different for him. 
 Beautiful in it's simplicity and message. Looking forward to introducing this one to my nephews as well."

 Main character is a tree, it is not so easy to illustration , and they managed it. 
 Although it is a topic that was often written, the Book described fear from a whole new perspective. 
 Some books would tell kids, the best way to conquer fear is be brave... not sure if that is the best way, if you are rave, blah blah blah. While my perspective is more like the one in this book. Especially for female, based o statistical data and due to difference in hormone between male and female. To conquer your fear, or procrastination, one really have to realize the harm of it, and suffer from it. A new fear of that harmless will naturally solve all the problems (no guarantee though), just like this little tree."

 I had never read The Lorax before yesterday, and I hadn't watched the movie. In class, we're studying economics when another teacher said, ""hey could I bring in The Lorax tomorrow?"" 
 Obviously, I'm familiar with Dr. Seuss - and the book, but I'd never read it. Still, I trust this other teacher who has yet to let me down. ""Sure, bring it in."" 
 The rest of this review is going to be a 7th grade social studies lesson, meant to help me remember to come back to this book next year. If there are other social studies teachers out there who want to know how I teach economics and specifically externalities (what they had been calling economic spillover), here you go: (I'll talk more about why The Lorax is about the economy rather than environment at the end...): 
 I tell the students that the economy deals with the production, distribution, and consumption of goods. We simplify it by saying it's making, sending/selling, and buying/using stuff. 
 This is why we think about money and jobs when we discuss the economy... making stuff is the job, which allows people to get money. 
 I then tell the kids a story. I want to get a drink of water. So, I start to pour myself a glass. While I'm pouring, some spills over onto the ground. A flower grows. Some also lands on a baby making it cry. 
 Why did I pour my water? Did I want to grow a flower? Did I want a baby to cry? No. I poured my water because I was thirsty. Those other things that happened were unintended consequences - both positive and negative - of pouring the glass of water. 
 When people build a factory, why do they do it? To make money. To make a profit. This is why the Once-ler built his Thneed factory. He wanted to make a profit. 
 He talks about the Brown Bar-ba-loots leaving, ""I the Once-ler, felt sad as I watched them all go. BUT... business is business! And business must grow regardless of crummies in tummies, you know."" 
 Did the Once-ler want the Brown Bar-ba-loots to leave? Did he want the air to darken? Was his intent for the Swomee-Swans to fly away, quieted? No. 
 Economic Spillover ( externality) = the positive and negative unintended consequences of economic development. 
 The Once-ler wanted his Thneeds to make money, and make money they did. 
 The problem is in a completely free and unregulated market economy, profit is god, at the expense of everything else - in this case, the book chooses to focus on the environment... but again, it's really about economics and corporate greed. 
 Of course Seuss isn't saying buying things (or market economy) is bad. We all have needs. ...But we also have Thneeds: things we think we need. And if our Thneeds are causing more harm than the amount we need them, maybe it's time to re-evaluate what we're buying and why. 
 Great book. I can't believe I haven't read it before."

Additionally, a key part of the story was conveyed via letters from Tara's grandmother and they were written in a pseudo-cursive font that I had trouble deciphering at times. The magical, mysterious elements were fun, though, and although I suspected how it was going to end, I didn't quite have it all figured out. The descriptions of the butterflies are beautiful and definitely made me want to take a trip to the Chuuk Islands!"

 I loved that the story had a strong heroine, who uses her mind to solve her problems. She has honed her leadership skills through being the eldest child with five younger siblings. She uses the leadership skills that she learned through her family to handle the new situations that she encounters on a pirate ship. Rachel realizes that she not only misses her family, but values them. The story has a great message about the important role that everyone plays in a family or on a pirate ship!

There are a few changes in the cast of teachers, and a completely different set of students, but this tale includes sibling interaction, the dangers of judging a book by its cover, and a number of other issues that kids will find interesting in a story. Plus, of course, a story about a young student training to be a Jedi. 
 In addition to the actual story, there are fake newspaper comics, parodies of Peanuts, Garfield and Family Circus, all told in Star Wars terms. Like the main character in the first Jedi Academy series, the main character is something of an artist, but that's not the main point of this story. It does help make the Drama Club sub-plot more convincing, though. 
 There are hints at a sub-plot about the main character's father, possibly to be explored in later books. Basically, though, it's just a lot of fun, set in the Star Wars universe before things went horribly wrong in Episode 1."

 Ozma of Oz 
 is quite clear, and it shows more as an adaptation of that book than its influence on 
 Tik-Tok of Oz 
 . Betsy Bobbin is called Betsy Baker, and she arrives in the Rose Kingdom (Oz is never mentioned in the text) in a chicken coop with a hen called Baden-Baden (Ironically, there is a Betsy Baker in the cast of Oz: The Great and Powerful--Sam Raimi bringing together the cast of his first feature, The Evil Dead) who contributes almost nothing to the story. Baum's attempts to appeal to popular taste are clear when Queen Ann of Oogaboo and Ozma the Rose Princess (known to Oz readers as Ozga) do a very anti-feminist duet. There's a concerted effort to pair off all the principals into romantic couples, as ridiculous as it sounds. The Shaggy Man is clearly presented as a younger man than he is in the books, and he is paired with Ann. Ruggedo, the Metal Monarch, who is king of ""Imps"" (all female) rather than ""Nomes,"" hates everyone, but falls for Polychrome with the aid of the Love Magnet, but she insists that she can only be loved from afar. Files and Ozma are paired off as in the book. In the climax, the Shaggy Man causes Tik-Tok to explode by hitting a button in his forehead that says ""Don't Touch,"" and Baum refers us to Arthur Voegtlein's descriptions of the special effects, which I would love to see. Betsy loves him and gathers his remains as though she is Isis collecting Osiris, and when he is put back together, he is mistaken for a ghost, a plot element that will be familiar to readers of 
 Little Wizard Stories of Oz 
 . (John R. Neill seemed to actually believe he was a ghost, as all subsequent books show Tik-Tok looking silvery in the color plates in spite of being described as a copper man.) Finally, the Love Magnet is dropped into Tik-Tok's head so that he and Betsy can be lovers. IT is already established early on that Tik-Tok runs based on love. Tik-Tok is also full of spoonerisms that he blames on his machinery and the patentee (the word follows seven Zs each time the running gag is done), and Baum makes more use of ""Pick me up"" than Walter Murch did in Return to Oz. The Shaggy Man's brother has only one line. I've read elsewhere that he is called ""Wiggy,"" but that name appears nowhere in this draft, which, as established, is not the final one. 
 The play is kind of fun, but it's still, in literary terms, far inferior to the Oz books. As shown above, Baum is here trying to appeal to popular tastes, and the show did tour for two years, although the critical response was that it was a knockoff of his earlier hit with the Broadway and touring versions of The Wizard of Oz, which was mostly rewritten by someone named Donnegan, and most of the songs he wrote were removed, apart from ""The Traveler and the Pie,"" which had nothing to do with the story. One of the songs here is clearly an imitation of that song. I know only a small sampling of the music here, but I could easily imagine music of that early 20th century pop style to accompany the lyrics presented, and no one would say that the music that I compose sounds anything like that style. The play's puns are better than that of The Woggle-Bug, but the plot structure is quite a bit weaker and dependent upon coincidences."

Now I regret not tracking it down when the kids were younger! Not that they suffered from lack of books, heaven knows, but this book is a rare gem. 
 The characterization is thin, but it's thin the way the characterization in a myth or a fairy tale is thin. There is a sense where most of the characters represent archetypes or symbols as much as they represent individuals. Few modern books achieve this level of resonance within modern rules of plot and characterization and whatnot. 
 While the surface appeal is obvious -- kids living through the summer with no adult supervision -- an added bonus is that the story is constructed in such a way that it could actually work. The kids are alone in the house, but they also have reliable adults close to hand, and a strong motive to maintain the patterns the adults in their own home set down. And the story presents the downside of their choice in retrospect -- it's no fun to be a kid ""shutting the house down"" and going to bed knowing you're in charge -- but in a gentle way that is not frightening to a smaller child and does not discount or undercut what the kids have accomplished. 
 A very satisfying book for a child, and I remember that satisfaction well reading it as an adult."

It genuinely does keep getting better and better. In this one the format is a little different- although we have the creepy Miss. Carcasse this is less of a ""monster of the week"" type story. It opens with Robert and Glenn in a perilous position but the book is based on what happens when Robert, his Mum, Mac the caretaker, Miss. Carcasse, snob child Lionel and Karina (although she is a ghost and can't leave anyway) get stuck in the school overnight during a snow-storm. 
 The series' develops here as things start to change. We are properly introduced to Crawford Tillinghast and something happens to one of the characters that really changes things. We are also given a great monster here, The Old Ones, which appear pretty cute yet remain terrifying at the same time. I was actually really impressed at how original and great these little monsters are. 
 As usual, Gilman tops up the fantasy with some genuine real-life issues. There's Robert trying to express his feelings to Karina displaying the difficulties of young love and Lionel Quincy serves as a great reminder that no matter how rich or good someone's life is they probably still have problems. There's also a great moment where Robert has to decide whether to sacrifice the annoying child and has to remind himself that as annoying as he is, he is still a person. 
 Yet again Gilman has unleashed another funny, spooky and action-packed story which the pre-teens market will really love. I look forward to seeing how the wonderful series progresses from here!"

 CATCHY QUOTE

 REVIEW 
 When asked to offer feedback to the author of My Best Friend is a Secret Agent I thought, 'OH NO! It's a kids' book.' And, you know what, it is a kids' book and, here's the shocker, I'm 38 years old and I loved it. And so did my daughter who sat and read it with me. 
 After we had finished we made a list of what we liked and didn't like. Here's the 'like' list: 
 1.	It's funny. Really, really funny. And not only the writing, the drawings are funny too. 
 2.	Chip Munson (character in book) is no Bond, but he's also very funny. 
 3.	The plot is exciting and it is almost impossible to work out what's going to happen next. 
 4.	The author has an amazing imagination. We (my daughter and I) reckon, if we met him at a party, we'd think he's a bit odd. We think he'd be standing there doing experiments on the punch. And he'd have on a hat similar to Inspector Gadget and there'd be a hammer sticking out of the top. 
 5.	The technology in it is super-cool; probably the best part of the book. 
 6.	The author really seems to understand what kids aged 8-13 enjoy to read. 
 Here's the 'didn't like' list: 
 1.	It ended. 
 My daughter and I would strongly recommend this story to any and all 8-108 year olds. But only if you enjoy following the antics of fantastically fun characters who are involved in a dastardly (I do love that word) devilish plot to destroy the town of Vortville.

Not only an environmental tale, but a poignant story about how one's actions don't take place in a bubble, but have a ripple effect that can be bad not only for others, but ultimately ourselves.

 This is a book to be read again and again."

What makes The Story for Kids stand out is how it is part of a larger campaign where entire families can receive the same message in a format best suited for their age level or reading comprehension. The publisher has presented the Bible's most important stories in a way so that it is comprehensible at each age level. The story for Kids is for 8-12 year olds and at the end of each story there is a section of discussion questions which work well for family devotional time. 
 The rating would be higher if there was a stronger sense of continuity between the Old Testament and New Testament. While the stories cover needed basics, there tends to be gaps, as if parts of the Bible are being fast forwarded. Overall, The Story for Kids suffices as an introductory beginning to the great stories of the Bible."

 I wish this book had been around when I was in fourth grade and a friend died in a fire. That was before the days of grief counseling in schools and such, so those of us who felt the loss weren't allowed to talk about it and just had to ignore our feelings and hope they'd go away. I hope that my son never has to go through the loss of a close friend like that, but if he does, at least now we've had a talk about how mourning is normal and okay. We probably wouldn't have if we hadn't read this book together."

Using their wits, friendship and bits of knowledge collected from books, the survivors procure life's essentials and set off to save themselves. Inadvertently, they discover a wondrous place that holds the key to their rescue, if only they can keep it a secret. 
 At once a classic adventure story and a modern day tale of the wonders of nature, Katherine Rundell's much anticipated middle grade novel brings the tradition of great survival stories to a new generation of readers. From poisonous ants and jungle fire to the simple joys of catching a fish and the glorious taste of honey, these lost children experience life's extremes in their days navigating the Amazon jungle. Along the way, they develop a revere for nature that displaces pride, arrogance and the need for attention. 
 Written for children aged 9 - 11, The Explorer will ignite the imaginations of children who enjoy adventure stories.

I guarantee that a reading and discussion of this book will make any child more environmentally-conscious."

 4+ stars to How the Grinch Stole Christmas!, a children's picture book, written in 1957 by Dr. Seuss. I adored this favorite as a child, and I still watch the cartoon ever year at Christmas. I've also seen the Jim Carrey movie and will watch that one, too. It's such a wonderful take of love and revenge... 
 Most folks who celebrate Christmas must have read or seen some version of this story at some point in their lives. If not, it's basically a grinch that wants to stop Christmas because he has no heart... but when he sees the heartache he causes on all the children who no longer have presents under the tree (because he stole them), his heart grows bigger... and he returns everything ten-fold. 
 It's a feel-good kinda story, when you are down and need something to make you feel better. But it has rhymes and beautiful pictures as well as moral lessons. 
 Every version brings something new to my eyes and mind and ears. I love this story and would watch it All the ""who"" people and the way the town celebrates Christmas... it's May and all I can think about is watching it right now!

It turns out Sweetie is quite intelligent and very quick to pick up tricks that Charles and his friends, David and Sammy, teach him. They hope these tricks will lead to Sweetie's adoption, but that's not all that happens as a result. 
 Miles works in lots of information on being a puppy foster home, therapy dogs, and the effort involved in having more than one dog in the home. She also works in dealing with some friendship issues common in threesomes and in facing and overcoming fears. It's all pretty innocuous and will be gobbled up by young dog lovers and early readers. The writing is fairly wooden and the book itself is unattractive--just pages of text with no illustrations to break things up, surprising in a book aimed at six- and seven-year-olds."

 K really enjoyed this book and learning how the American West was before. 
 I love how much information these books give you on the past and in a fun way. K didn't like the meals that were given on the way to the new homestead. He thought it sounded gross but hey you eat what you have. 
 We learn how you traveled, what you carried with you, to even when you made it to where you were going how you survived there.

 One Good Thing About America is a wonderful book about Anais, a young girl who has just immigrated to the United States from the Congo. Her mother and younger brother are with her in Maine and trying to adjust to life in the United States. Unfortunately, her father is in hiding from the Congolese government and her brother has also stayed behind. 
 The book follows Anais as she navigates 4th grade in a new school where she struggles with the language, even though back home she had been top in English. The book is written as letters that Anais writes to her grandmother, Oma, back in the Congo. Her grandmother requires her to write her letters in English so that she can practice the language, and the fact that she has trouble with grammar and spelling make her situation more relatable and realistic. It also allows the reader to grow with her as she figures things out. 
 As with most books that focus on the immigrant experience, Anais struggles with the foods, customs, and holidays that the students are so accustomed to. When her classmates struggle with the pronunciation of her name, they wind up calling her Annie instead of Anais. Anais is also required to be in an English Language Learner class (ELL) for part of her day. Freeman truly understands the importance of those classes as she was an ELL teacher herself, which was the inspiration for this story. 
 When Anais is constantly complaining to Oma about the ""Crazy Americans"" and how much she would like to go home to the Congo, Oma makes her write ""one good thing about America"" in each of her letters. Sometimes this is an easy task, like when she has her first taste of potato chips, ice cream, and pizza. Sometimes it is less easy, like when she plans to wear a fancy dress to school before Christmas vacation but instead the have ""pajama day."" 
 One Good Thing About America is a quick read that is incredibly hard to put down. Anais is such a sweet young girl that you want to see how her year develops and how she adjusts. J and I both read it and really enjoyed it. 
 Books like this are so important for our children to read. They allow kids who have been through the immigration process see that they are not alone. It shows American kids how difficult it is to be a refugee and to struggle with language and culture. Seeing it from Anais' perspective allows elementary aged kids to have empathy for her experience and hopefully for other children like her. A marvelous book!"

Certainly, Carroll's work is an exemplar of stories in which the main character is thrust into a strange and fantastic world that he/she mistakenly entered (i.e. falling down the rabbit hole). Full of curious events and characters that have become a lasting part of popular consciousness (the Mad Hatter, Cheshire Cat, Queen of Hearts, etc.), the book revels in nonsense. Carroll, a mathematician and logician, seems to revels in the word play of nonsense--that is, twisting logic until it becomes illogical and absurd. 
 I love this book. I think it's something that works on a number of levels. You don't have to ""get"" everything about the book to enjoy it. And I think above all else, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is meant to be fun."

That is to say, once Flea gets whisked off to the North Pole the action really starts! Exactly why Flea is there, why he is so talented and why he is lumped with two seeming failures who have never graduated from Elf School forms the mystery at the heart of the book, and one that is only slightly revealed by the end. But then as the series implies, he has five Christmases to work out the answer! 
 The story is well written, and full of wonderfully imaginative problems, punishments, and nasty situations as well as fun things and inventive means of transport. I admire an author who comes up with filling someone's room with snowballs as a bully's way of getting at them. I did find it irritating that any onomatopaeic words were italicised, sometimes in the same sentence as words where italics were used for stress. I don't think the wind howling or the snowball whooshing adds anything, and to me it detracted from the readability. 
 But I did enjoy the story, and felt the characters were well established. The wider plot is nicely introduced, and left at a very nice point so that I want to find out what happens next while being satisfied by the end of this story. A cleverly plotted book with plenty of twists and seasonal references that I'm sure all the family will enjoy. 
 P.S. Having started by saying it takes a while to get going, I will now backtrack and say it probably doesn't take any more time than it took Hagrid to turn up and say, ""You're a wizard, Harry."" Maybe it was more predictable from the descriptions of Flea's problems? Maybe it was because there was a Prologue? I don't know. I do know that I'm looking forward to the next book in the series. 
 This is one of my 4.5 star reads. But I've marked it in the 5 because although I wont read it again, I will read the next one!"

 I'm always looking for light reading. It gives my brain a break from things mathematical and composition oriented. 
 I also just started re-reading A Girl of the Limberlost which is a horrifying experience. It's not horrifying in a bad way, just horrifying in a reliving the past kind of way. More about that book will be in my challenge post for the books I love reading challenge nearer the end of the month. 
 Davey though - pure magic. First, since it's in the title of this post, defining grand narrative (meta-narrative) is probably appropriate. 
 A meta-narrative is 'the big story' and it strives to explain the 'why' of the universe, or society or perhaps culture in some cases. Religion, Fascism, Communism & Feminism are just a few of the examples of meta-narratives that come to mind. 
 If I say that another way, it's an abstract idea that the author believes explains comprehensively historical experiences and knowledge. 
 Why is this important for Davey the Detective? Well, children's stories can be written for a variety of reasons. There are books that seek to teach kids things like the alphabet, or numbers. There are books that are just non-sensical and fun, and then there are books that are trying to teach a lesson, or explain something to the mind and eyes of a child. 
 Explaining good vs. evil, truth vs. lying and why humans do the things we do to a child can be a little challenging. Thank goddness there are some excellent writers out there like Emlyn Chand who can explain with grace and beauty the huge concepts and meta-narratives of life through kid lit. 
 This answers only one simply question about kids books, and that's why we read them at all. If you're an adult and have kids, you might do it to make them fall asleep at bed or nap-time, but you may also do it because the book helps explain something your child is currently struggling with. Whether it's sheer entertainment, or for a bigger reason, Davey the Detective should be in your library. 
 Davey, is a juvenile crow, and he's accompanied by his best friend Sarah the Sparrow. This book is brilliant in part because of its aspects of realism. Crows are often seen flying with other small birds around them (because they're good at finding food as they are scavengers). So the book is chalk full of teachable moments for any parent or teacher reading the book to an audience of young children. 
 In the book, Davey finds something beautiful and shiny (Also teachable, crows like shiny things, and are one of the few birds that will 'impress' upon objects and people.) It might be a common every day object to us humans, but it is special to Davey. Then, he loses it! He looks for it everywhere, but finally enlists his friend and they go about hunting Holmes and Watson style for his missing precious object. 
 The story brings out a vast array of emotions, from frustration to disappointment, from friendship to relief. It's moral 'think before you accuse' and 'apologize when you are wrong' are beautifully illustrated in the writing and the images. Even though Mr. Bushtail is angry with Davey and Sarah, he forgives them, and Davey learns his lesson. The book is so realistic it could be about kids in school, not birds. It actually reminds me of the Bernstein Bear books, and is just as gorgeous to look at. The birds have human expressions and the style of writing flows easily off the tongue. 
 Davey the Detective was the first children's book I bought in an ebook format. I have to say I'm not disappointed at all. In fact, it got me thinking about the future of children's literature. 
 In Startrek Voyager, the kids have holodecks with programs that are children's stories. The one pictured below is Naomi Wyldeman in an episode about fire destroying a rain forest. It too has a grander narrative that speaks to how humans and the world can't keep going around with out all the elements (fire, earth, air and water). 
 In the same way that Davey learns his lesson, so does the fire, and eventually the fire and water sprites become friends and learn that they can work together. Just like Davey, Sarah and Mr. Bushtail. 
 The future is here? Almost? Please? 
 I am quite sure that it's becoming more and more common to read children stories with ebooks all snuggled up in bed. I for one can see a future where we do have holodecks, but maybe first some interactive stories and video games for Wii or other gaming platforms that are stories like Davey the Detective. In fact, I think all the Bird Brained books Emlyn's writing and planning to write would make excellent games. 
 I hope you'll take time to check out Emlyn's kid lit, and maybe even stop by Amazon to buy it. It's a great resource, and if you buy it in ebook format it won't even take up room in your hectic life if your a parent. 
 Davey the Detective is available on Amazon in ebook and print format. You can read more about the book on GoodReads, and follow the author on Facebook, Twitter, GoodReads and her own website.

 Argyle Fox is an intelligent little fox that may seem stubborn when he's continually trying to play games that others are telling him won't work in the strong wind, but I thought this showed strength of character. He wasn't being rude to them, but rather learning for himself why something might not be plausible, such as building a card tower outside when it's windy. 
 His inevitable turn to kite flying is nice, though I question whether knitting a tail for the kite (the inspiration from his mother's knitting) would have worked quite as well as is pictured in the book. A lot of yarn is quite heavy and given the size of the kite, I think it would've weighed Argyle Fox's kite down rather than enabled it to soar as shown. 
 Regardless, this tale is a good one about perseverance and learning to work with what you have. Argyle Fox tried to play with a variety of things, such a card towers and a cardboard castle, that simply didn't work. In the end, flying kites with your friends, especially with kites you made for them, can be just as enjoyable. 
 I received a copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."

 A couple of days ago, I finished my thirteenth book, Captain Underpants and the Big, Bad Battle of the Bionic Booger Boy, Part 1: The Night of the Nasty Nostril Nuggets, in English this year. 
 I bought this book at a church sale only for 25 cents in America. When I saw the book to my American friend, she said that all boys love the book series. While I was reading, I figured out why American boys love the book series. The contents relates to boogers, poops or whatever little boys like. Even though this book is very immature, I enjoyed reading it. 
 I want to read the book series from the first one soon."

I sometimes can't understand the British accent and expressions. I think watching the video clips is a good idea to become used to them. 
 When I started to read the book, I thought it was easy. While I was keeping on reading it, I realized that it was not super easy even it's a kid's book. I found many unknown words in the book. I love Paddington. He is a lovely bear because of his character. He is a troublemaker and without realizing, he jumps into many tables. However, everybody loves him. Since I was a kid, I have been a BIG fan of teddy bears. I've been collecting a lot of bears. I hope I can get Padddington some day!"

Two boys, Joey, and Roger bring friendship and some stability into Sam's life, and Carmela, the nurturer, who in many ways is the surrogate mother, that keeps caring and loving alive in Sam's heart. 
 The Sign of the Green Dragon tells the story of a boy who wants to help his team win the district baseball championship. Torn between with his desire to help his team, and his Uncle's wish to send him to boarding school, the center stage is set. C. Lee McKenzie does an excellent job of weaving this into a multicultural tale. 
 Think C.S. Lewis and the world of Narnia, 
 See kids separated from their parents, 
 Imagine the magical closet, 
 And you will find yourself sinking into C. Lee McKenzie's world. 
 Like Lewis, McKenzie bids us to walk with Sam, Joey, and Roger. We feel the suspense as he and his two friends, find the large wooden chest and our hearts beat quickly when they discover the Sign of the Green Dragon. 
 I like the way McKenzie grabs our attention with her opening line. 
 So, what did I do wrong this time? 
 It is Sam thinking aloud, twisted in his feelings toward his uncle as he sits opposite him. 
 A fan of Nancy Drew, a character created by Edward Stratemeyer, I enjoy young adult mysteries, and The Sign of the Green Dragon is indeed an excellently well-crafted mystery that will keep you turning the pages. It presents the character, maturation, strength, and courage wrapped around one boy's desire to help.

 '...don't forget 
 whose always our guide 
 It is always the child in us!!' 
 The other day, i heard my hubby talking to his friend about the pains i take to get hold of the gems in children's literature, so as to inculcate the love of reading in my kids. But apparently he is as yet unaware that introducing our kids to the fascinating world of books is only a collateral aim. The primary aim is to devour them myself!! 
 Talking about the Grinch,i had seen the movie long back and loved it and now i love the book much more. A simple tale about the spirit of Christmas, told in a few simple words and beautifully illustrated by Dr. Seuss. Its a treat to watch the different emotions sketched on the usually grumpy face of Mr. Grinch. One cannot suppress the urge to shout in joy at the Grinch's journey from having 'a heart two sizes too small' to one that 'grew three sizes' on the Christmas eve and at his realisation that... 
 ""May be Christmas doesn't come from a store. 
 May be Christmas ...perhaps ... means a little bit more!"" 
 The Grinch failed miserably in his attempt to stop Christmas from coming. In spite of robbing every who down in Who-ville of their X-mas trees, their feasts,their presents, the ribbons, the wrappings, the tags, the tinsel, the trimmings and the trappings.... Christmas came and the Grinch was shocked to see the people merry and singing together. It was then, at the end of long hours puzzling till his 'puzzler got sore'that the realisation came and he lost the tightness of his heart once and for all. Then, was there anything else for the Grinch to do, but to run down from his icy cold cave and to embrace the warmth of the Christmas spirit, along with the rest of the townfolk. 
 After reading aloud the story to my kids, i asked my elder son,'So... what is Christmas all about, if not about gifts and feasts?' and he said'its about being happy'. I don't think i have anything to add to that."

When I saw the title and the book cover, I was led into thinking that the book is about a badger literally handing out gifts before he dies. It turned out that no actual gift giving took place. 
 Susan Varley's writing is so beautiful that you wouldn't mind that the text on each page is longer than most picture books. I love how she incorporates Badger's own thoughts and feelings about death and dying. You don't see this often in picture books. Sometimes, we adults need to be creative in helping children understand the complexity of Life and Death. Thankfully, Susan Varley understands that need. Badger makes use of a euphemism for death: going down the Long Tunnel. 
 My favorite part in the book is Fox's memory of Badger, in which Badger showed Fox how to tie a knot properly. Susan Varley handled it with such gentleness. This book made me think that badgers are better friends than humans! At least in Badger's case! 
 There is so much to love about Susan Varley's picture book. Her pen and ink, and watercolor illustrations are wonderful and teeming with affection. Badger's Parting Gifts not only shows us that our deceased loved ones live on through warm and loving memories of them but also when we share with others the things they've taught us when they were still alive. 
 So, was I disappointed when I found out that no actual gift giving took place in the book? No. If these lovely pages from the book do not convince you that the book deserves your attention, I don't know what else will."

 The last Pilkey book we read was the disgustingly over-the-top Super Diaper Baby. Now back to the core series we found the gross out factor is destined to remain high. 
 In this book Harold and George, our heroes, teach their classmates a prank called ""Squishies"" which will have parents checking the toilet before sitting down for weeks. Their classmate Melvin Sneedly tries to show off an invention that combines two things (like a bionic robot and a hamster). Despite being smart Melvin is not a good kid and he reacts badly to his classmates being less interested in watching him yell at his hamster than trying out a prank. 
 Probably not the best of moves, Harold and George turn Melvin into a spoiled brat monster in one of their comics which pushes Melvin to show everyone how much cooler he is than George and Harold by turning himself into a bionic robot. Too bad Melvin has allergies and sneezes right before the combining. 
 Surprisingly Melvin, unlike the rest of Harold and George's victims, doesn't turn evil until he's assaulted by a tissue man on a school field trip. Then George, Harold and Captain Underpants have to defeat their grossest bad guy yet, and all during cold and flu season. 
 Despite what parents think, kids adore this series. It has the right combination of gross, funny and meat to it. And it does redeem itself by showing that you don't have to get straight As or always be right to be the good guy. It also pokes fun at itself and combines a subtle use of language with the subject matter which helps push middle grade reader boundaries. 
 I'd be surprised if libraries don't already have this series, but parents looking for books to encourage their kids to read for pleasure outside of school should definitely try this series. It's funny, gross, sometimes a little bit scary, but all in a safe way. 
 Contains: Gross jokes and illustrations

 There are no baddies in this story: its heroes battle against the elements and their own limitations. But it's quite an epic struggle in which they're at real risk of death. 
 Readers should be warned that this is a sea story written by a sailing enthusiast: non-sailors may find that the blow-by-blow account tells them more than they wanted to know about sailing. 
 Also note before reading that it dates from 1937, so it's somewhat old-fashioned in general. The world before the Second World War was significantly different from the world we know now. 
 A story like this couldn't plausibly be set in modern times, because at least two of the children would have mobile phones, which would wreck the whole plot."

However, I think that somewhere deep in my psyche this book has become part of the way I deal with loss because I read it at such a young age. I do recommend the book for the younger set.

 Chissa come, non mi sono mai preoccupata del fatto che potesse esserci un libro. Davo per scontato che non esistesse, eppure.... 
 eppure sono arrivata all'alba dei ventisei anni senza averlo mai letto. 
 Come poter resistere? 
 Cosi, sfruttando la nuova adesione alla biblioteca del paese (miracoloooooo), ho deciso di dargli del tu in modo serio e maturo. 
 Ammetto che e stato strano leggere un libro in rima. Divertente, ok... ma anche difficile. Dovevo entrare ""nella parte"" ma ala fine ci sono riuscita. 
 Per la maggior parte del tempo, libro e film vanno a braccetto. Cosa particolarmente strana a cui non sono esattamente abituata ma va benissimo cosi. 
 Il finale pero, per quanto gioioso in tutte e due le parti, insegna qualcosa di diverso. 
 Nel film, viene rimarcato piu volte che la cattiveria del Grinch e nata sopratutto per colpa delle azioni di alcuni bambini. Il suo modo di fare e dettato anche da una rabbia repressa che poi viene... sistemata. Certo, non e l'unico motivo per cui decide di rovinare il natale ai non-so-chi ma diciamo che incide moltissimo. 
 Nel libro invece, la parte dell'infanzia del Grinch non esiste. Quindi, in questo caso, la storia gira intorno solo al fatto che per lui, la festa del natale e solo commerciale e priva di sentimento. Non lo dice con queste parole ma il senso e quello. Nel libro non esiste la mini storia d'amore e non c'e il sincero sacrificio della piccola non-so-chi. In questa storia, l'unico e assoluto protagonista e Lui. 
 Devo dire che apprezzo tutte e due le versioni. 
 Il film, perche ci sono cresciuta. Il libro, perche e piu incisivo."

Four children are transported to a magical land where they must fight to save a race of unicorns from the clutches of the malevolent bat-like Merradagh. In addition, they must help a lovelorn male dragon rescue his true love from the curse of the same Merradah. To return to their own world, the children need the permission from the unicorn king, but they must first complete their mission. The story is sprinkled nicely with many other dangers and obstacles that our four adventures must overcome. 
 The story drips with foreboding atmosphere that keeps the reader on the edge of their seat. The book is scary, along the lines of Percy Jackson, yet not too much for the average middle school reader. 
 This is an exciting and rewarding story that children will be drawn to - like a bat to ripe fruit."

True, maybe, that the artwork and language are not as great as the other Seuss books, its message is very important. Perhaps the Onceler could have been made more evil. The pictures of environmental destruction more grim. The pictures of runaway industrial production more frightening. I still like the book and its concepts, which most adults don't understand.

His uptight uncle plans to send him away to boarding school which means Sam will miss the play-offs for his baseball team. With the help of his friends, Joey and Roger, they plan to hide Sam in a cave until the game. An earthquake hits while the boys are there and reveals a secret room with a treasure map. If the kids can reveal the truth about an old murder, they'll find the treasure. But the ancient Chinese dragons don't give up their secrets easily, and the boys could miss more than the big game if they aren't careful! 
 A fantastic middle grade read with a lot of fun sleuthing and adventuring. Sam and his friends are the typical 11-12 year old boys. Good kids but with a knack for finding trouble. And who can resist an old mystery that includes a secret treasure? Joey and Roger just want to help their friend, and Sam longs for a stable home that he lost after his parents died. It's easy to sympathize with them, and I cheered them on from the beginning. 
 I loved the history of the Chinese in California and the mystical aspects of the story. The twists and turns kept me guessing as to what might happen. It's a funny, suspenseful, and fast-paced ride."

 Liam is a precocious child, who has a nasty temper. I loved this little boy, as he tried to tame his temper by getting rid of it. I could have told him that his method wouldn't work, because I've tried it myself! But, pull it out he does! Now he has a temper that is running amok! What then happens is an adventure that every child can somewhat relate to! I know, because I was one once (hard to believe, I know!). 
 This is a fantastic story book about trying to control your temper. It is told in such a way that it entertains, and keeps even the most shortest attention span hooked! I love the illustrations that are drawn in the book. They are done artfully and with great expression. I especially love the one showing Liam besides his artwork on the wall. I could feel what he felt, because I've been in the same situation and could relate.

And middle schools are already pretty dang terrifying. Three friends - not all entirely human - and some adults, including a very odd substitute librarian, wind up stuck in their school after a freak blizzard hits the town. The children are resourceful and clever, but still hilariously awkward as most middle schoolers are. Kids and adults should enjoy these books. They remind me a bit of the Lemony Snicket and Fablehaven writing styles. 
 Some aspects of the book are a bit dark for kids' stuff - i.e., souls stored in ceramic urns, several dead characters - that probably would have upset me. Actually, I'm a softie so it still bugs me. I hope the author restores to life all of the victims sometime in his series. The substitute, Miss Carcasse, barely makes an appearance in the story. Some creatures called ""Old Ones"" that look like Popples with shark teeth are the primary Lovecraftian critter here. 
 I'd never heard of the series until I won an ARC, but the book does a good job of bringing the reader up to speed on the Lovecraft Middle School situation. I plan to read the first three volumes in order just to learn the backstories. I wish this series had been around when I was a kid. Many people compare this to ""Goosebumps"", but it reminded me more of the ""Wayside School"" series.

 And that, in and of itself, is the true message at the heart of The Lorax. Yes, you do have all the pro-environmental messages (important and just as relevant in this day, and that is unlikey to change) and many good quips about the shallowness of society (when is that never not relevant?), but at the end of the day, that ""nothing"" mentioned above - that just doesn't apply to the environment. It applies to EVERYTHING that can be changed, and should be changed, for the better, and will not be unless we care. And that is at the heart of this story - care about things you can change while you can, or else."

Scariest moment in the book recommendation game! This thirteen year old reader loves speculative fiction, and is very picky, in a good way. She's a clever girl. 'How about a differently perfect book?' I ask with some trepidation. 
 Sometimes introducing new kinds of books to readers is like introducing new vegetables to babies and toddlers. You might be lucky, and they'll view it suspiciously, but let you put the spoon in their mouth, taste it, widen their eyes, and open their mouths for more. Or they might spit it out, perfectly aiming for any new or white clothing, and never let that vegetable within high chair reach again. I'm a believer in persistence though. Let a little time pass and try again. And again. And again. 
 And so it is with this young reader. For the last year I have been working very hard to get her to try something new. Something with a texture that is a little different, with a flavour that is novel (I know, but an irresistible pun - right?), and most of all something that is nutritious. Because she is a clever girl, and she needs to digest a wider range of food groups in her reading. 
 I pull 'Rooftoppers' out of my back pack. I have the advantage here. All of the children want to read Mrs OW's newest books. And this one is beautiful. It has a smoky cover with gorgeous silver embossed writing, and a mysterious moonlit skyline of rooftops, and the silhouette of a character sitting on the rooftops, playing a cello. Everyone wants to hold it. Even a few of the boys are standing a row or two back, trying not to look too interested. I read the blurb, (something like) 'On the morning of its first birthday, a baby is found floating in a cello case in the middle of the English Channel.' What's a rooftopper? Why a cello case? What's a cello? (sadly), are questions that are flying around the room. 
 After making a quick mental note that I must do something about their musical education, I pull the shimmering silver arrow out of my quiver, and draw the bow. 'Listen to this...' 
 And I read the first few pages. Audible gasps roll like Mexican waves around the classroom as I read lines like, 'Think of night-time with a speaking voice. Or think how moonlight might talk, or think of ink, if ink had vocal chords. Give those things a narrow aristocratic face with hooked eyebrows, and long arms and legs, and that is what the baby saw as she was lifted out of her cello case and up into safety.' 
 And chuckles ripple to, 'The baby was almost certainly one year old. They knew this because of the red rosette pinned to her front, which read '1!' 'Or rather,' said Charles Maxim, 'the child is either one year old, or she has come first in a competition. I believe babies are rarely keen participants in competitive sport. Shall we therefore assume it is the former.' Charles names the baby Sophie and takes her home, because she is his responsibility now. 
 Charles Maxim is a beautifully eccentric character, who is both entirely unconcerned about propriety and utterly determined to fight for what is proper. When the Child Services want to take Sophie into care, Charles reluctantly agrees to their visits: 
 'Certainly, please do come,' said Charles - and he added, as if he couldn't stop himself, 'if you feel you absolutely can't stay away. I will endeavour to be grateful. But this child is my responsibility. Do you understand?' 
 'But it's a child! You are a man!' 
 'Your powers of observation are formidable,' said Charles. 'You are a credit to your optician.' 
 Before I have even finished reading this, the title of the book is on the whiteboard, and names have been listed underneath, of those who want to read the book. Bulls eye! But I have one more arrow quivering. My student is starting to look a little anxious that she may not have this book first, after all. Others are clamouring for it. They all have good reasons for why they should have it first. But I know this book is meant for her. Her name is Sophie. 
 Katherine Rundell's 'Rooftoppers' has been referred to as luminous, and extraordinary, and poetic. It has an ending controversial enough to argue over. It is not so perfect that you can't disagree over what you like about it - some of it feels a little overworked, and some of it feels a little bit precious. But that's good. It gives the book its character. 
 In the end, though, the truth is in the reading. The very next day Sophie brought 'Rooftoppers' back in to school, having finished it already. She wasn't keen to let it go, but reluctantly handed it over to the next reader on the list, who has also already finished it and passed it on to the next. I had to buy a kindle version, so that I could write this review. But I would recommend the hard copy, hardcover for preference. It is a book you need to hold, to feel the heft of it."

I read about a girl losing her little brother out by the old lighthouse, and I told Adam and Watch that we should help find him. The police don't believe her story about a beam of light coming from the lighthouse and a howling ghost grabbing her brother. I know she's telling the truth. I convinced the boys to help me investigate, but I didn't expect Adam to risk his life in shark-infested waters or climbing the abandoned lighthouse. Of course, I was right in the end, and it was my idea that rescued the little boy. 
 You don't need to read the first book in the series to enjoy this one. I enjoyed this book a bit more, because it focused on one clearly-defined problem. A little boy is missing, and the kids work to solve his mystery. Book one had the kids traveling to an alternate dimension, whereas they use their knowledge and resources to solve the problem in this one. The first book showed Sally's loving feelings for Adam, and she becomes a bit jealous in this book when he shows kindness for Cindy, the sister of the little boy. Once again, Adam doesn't know what to think. The books in this series are easy to read, and they present mystery and adventure for readers. I recommend them for light-hearted mystery lovers."

No matter your age, I think we all need a reminder that we shouldn't let others define how we feel about ourselves, because ultimately what our Maker thinks is more important."

 What an absolutely delightful book! Argyle Fox longs to play outside and has so many great ideas: building a card tower, scary spider and web, pirate and soccer. The wind disrupts each of his activities and his frustration becomes evident. Like most young children, he eventually gives in to pouting and sitting. His mother encourages him to think through the problem and come up with an activity that he can do in the wind. Eventually, Argyle comes up with the perfect solution! 
 This book has beautiful illustrations done in gouache paint that are only part of why I love this book. There are so many details to draw in the reader and young children will see details in each page. 
 A big focus in education right now is fostering a growth mindset; problem solving is a big part of that movement and in this book, we see Argyle Fox face discouragement but then working through a problem until he finds a solution. This book will be wonderful with young readers to plant the seeds of overcoming problems and with older readers who can make even more text-to-self connections and open dialogue on problem-solving."

Never having met her, he is unsure what to expect--except that she's crazy. She owns the Intergalactic Bed & Breakfast. It doesn't take David too long to realize that it is, in fact, an intergalactic Bed & Breakfast. 
 As David's grandmother comes to depend on his help running the Inn, with all its unusual requirements, David begins to realize how much it means to him that his grandmother places such trust and responsibility in him. He grows from being resentful and dismissive of his grandmother and her business to defending her at all cost--even his own public humiliation. 
 Aliens on Vacation is by turns sweet (although not too much so) and funny. It's a perfect read-aloud choice for middle elementary ages or as an independent reading choice. Boys and girls alike will enjoy Scrub and his experiences with the extraterrestrial life forms at his grandmother's vacation destination--particularly the camp-out excursion!"

 'Just as Long As We're Together' is the story of Steph, a girl just starting 7th grade. Her best friend is Rachel Robinson, but at the start of the book they befriend another girl named Alison. Starting junior high means there's a lot of change for the three girls - as well as learning a new routine, they also face the complicated issues of boys and less-than-perfect family situations. Rachel seems to be moving away from Steph, and she finds herself spending more time with their new friend Alison. She also finds out that Rachel has been keeping secrets, and then Steph herself starts keeping a secret that she barely knows how to deal with herself. 
 Friends, family, boys, school, all that stuff that every teen girl faces, all stuff that Steph has to try to work her way through, all stuff that Judy Blume captures effortlessly. 
 'Just as Long As We're Together' is a quick read with lots of humour and warmth, but, in typical Blume style, it tackles difficult issues. Despite the fact that it was first published in 1987, this book doesn't feel dated (beyond Steph's younger brother's nightmares about 'the Bomb' although, hey, bombs are still scary!) and could as easily take place in the nineties or early noughties (pre-mass social networking and every kid over at least 11 having a mobile phone). That said, its age does mean that there's still the rather touching aspect of kids actually, omg, calling each other ON THE HOUSE LANDLINE rather than just texting/Facebook-ing each other, which is sweet."

Though they are primarily aimed at kids and teens (11 +) the stories are all damn creepy. I particularly enjoy the influences in all four books - they all have a framing device, usually involving a child or children being told a series of creepy stories by a mysterious adult. This reminds me a lot of those wonderful Amicus horror compendiums (Tales from the Crypt, Asylum, The House That Dripped Blood, The Vault of Horror etc) which I *love*. Also, as the title of the first of his books suggests - 'Uncle Montague' - all his stories have something of the chilling flavour of M.R, James about them (my favourite ghost story writer). 
 In this collection of three stories, a teacher turns up at a school to read a class a series of three scary stories as part of World Book Day. Throughout, as with the previous collections, you get the same sense that there's something creepy going on below the surface of this apparently simple framing device. I thought I had it figured....but I didn't!!!! The ending really, really creeped me out in the way the best ghost/horror stories should. The three stories themselves are also pretty creepy and disturbing. 
 My only quibble is that I wish this could have been a longer collection like 'Uncle Montague', 'Black Ship' and 'Tunnel's Mouth'. Dear Mr. Priestley, should you read this, please write another collection soon!!!!! 
 A short but creepy read!"

 Gr 5-8-Paul Stewart and Chris Riddell's first book in the series (Random, 2004) is chock full of bizarre happenings, incongruities, and perilous adventures. Thirteen-year-old Twig always knew he was different. When his wood troll mother tells him he isn't a wood troll and that she found him as a baby, Twig begins to wonder about who he really is and where he came from. He visits a wood troll family member and runs into trouble almost immediately as he strays from the path. Twig has a number of strange encounters, especially a dangerous and terrifying one with a tree. The Deepwoods is populated with all manner of weird and quirky characters, not the least of which are trees and rocks that float when heated, sky pirates, and the most horrible creature of all-the gloamglozer. Fantasy lovers will enjoy this brisk, somewhat predictable tale with a twist of the unusual.-Charli Osborne, Oxford Public Library, Oxford, MI"

The endings of fairy tales never take into account what happens after the prince wins some winsome damsel or the princess is handed some handsome prince. In this one, the bloom is definitely off the rose as the princess and her pond-loving husband argue and bicker. Having enough, he decides he was better off as an amphibian and sets off to find a witch to help him. 
 The story takes us from one well-known fairy tale magic wielder to another as the prince vainly pursues his desire. The text is matched with angular drawings of the peregrinating pop-eyed prince (suggesting his former froggy appendages). Humor abounds as he evades the dangerous enchantresses along the way (hey, this guy knows his fairy tales as well as anyone!) and finally remembers what was important to him. 
 With a cover that mimics a thicker, leather-bound tome, this is a funny little story about what happens after happily ever after."

See him outrun the malodorous halitoad! Witness him fight a poisonous hover worm! Watch as he barely escapes the flesh-eating maw of a bloodoak! Applaud when he breaks out from the bowels of the gluttonous Gyle Goblin Colony! Gasp while he tries to outpace the ravenous wig-wigs! 
 It's just one thing after another for poor Twig. But he's a likeable fellow. You can't help but cheer him on as he wanders, eager to find his place in the world. The book also has a startling but familiar revelation and the reappearance of an old nemesis. Both give a purpose and meaning to Twig's meandering and bring the novel to a satisfying close. 
 If you were ever a fan of old-time Saturday morning serials, complete with actions of derring-do and cliffhangers (or even if you're not), this installment in the Edge Chronicles will more than satisfy."

 Okay so that's my sad attempt at reviewing in Dr. Seussian. Hardy har har. I love The Lorax. I love Dr. Seuss. Actually, I have every intention of decorating my children's nursery in Dr. Seuss trimmings. I know a lot of people have controversy about the message he's trying to send here, but honestly, I think people can be a little overly-critical of children's picture books. Unless the information is deliberately inaccurate, just take it at face value and look at it through the eyes of a child. Sometimes the simplest lessons are the best lessons, and you just need to enjoy the ride. My children will most definitely know who Dr. Seuss is! Also, did you know they have a pop-up book, too?"

Und weil er ein Schild tragt auf dem steht ,,Bitte kummern sie sich um diesen Baren"", bieten sie ihm an bei ihnen zu wohnen. Sie taufen ihn auf den Namen Paddington. Hatten sie geahnt wie viel Chaos so ein kleine Bar anrichten und wie viel Marmelade er verputzen kann, hatten sie es sich vielleicht noch einmal uberlegt. Doch auf der anderen Seite ist Paddington wieder so lieb und putzig, so unschuldig naiv, dass man gar nicht anders kann als das kleine Kerlchen ins Herz zu schliessen. 
 Aufmerksam geworden durch den Film, habe ich mir den ersten Band mit Geschichten um Paddington auf meinen Kindle geladen und ich habe es nicht bereut. Ich habe mich kostlich amusiert, uber Paddingtons Versuche unsere zivilisierte Welt zu verstehen. Er ist dabei so herrlich uberzeugt davon was er tut, dass man ihm nicht einmal bose sein kann, wenn um ihn herum alles im Chaos versinkt und das nur weil er eine Rolltreppe benutzen wollte. Ausserdem finde ich den Namen absolut passend fur so ein kleines putziges Kerlchen, dass gern mal alles auf den Kopf stellt. Ich kann absolut verstehen, warum der Bar sogar eine eigene Bronzestatue an der Paddingtonstation bekommen hat. 
 Einfach nur ein allerliebstes Lesevergnugen."

 I liked that this book had quick reminders of what had happened in the first three books, both at the beginning of the book, and again at the end. I think it's good for kids to not only learn to read chapter books, but also learn about book series, and how books build on each other. My little guy had picked up some later books, so it was fun to finally MEET Morgan for the first time. 
 I really like how this series teaches the kids a little about a subject in such an easy to read manner. I really don't mind quickly reading them myself (like I do some other kids books)."

 As a kid, I loved listening to my Paddington audiobook on MC, but I actually never read the books. 
 Last year, I watched the movie adaption, which I also enjoyed. Not only was the movie cast perfect, but also the plot was really touching and heartwarming. 
 I had the same feeling while reading this book, but it was more intense. To be honest, it moved me to tears a little bit. The story and the characters are so lovely, and Browns accept and love Paddington immediately and unconditionally. They are never like 'Really, Paddington? Again?', because they know that he's doing his best and he doesn't want to harm anyone. He always comes from a place of love, they all come from a place of love. Except the mean neighbour, Mr. Curry. And I loved the scenario on Paddington's birthday party, because everyone except Mr. Curry was so positive and loved to celebrate that Paddington was among them. 
 I don't know, I think it's just a very positive book with great values, kind of like the Harry Potter series, but without the tragedy and deaths. I really really really enjoyed ist and I'm definitely going to continue reading the series."

 The title refers to children who live on the Paris rooftops, because anything is better than a Paris orphanage. 
 Rundell's prose is exquisite, but I wanted more. The ending felt a little abrupt and incomplete to me. If she writes a sequel, I might give this book a fifth star."

I love that this book recounts some of the same adventures he experienced and I can't wait to read it to him.

 The Land of Green Ginger is a wonderful children's book, and as an added bonus makes for a wonderful adult book as well. I first came across it many years ago, as a young child, from a public library. I then lost track of it for a while before finding it again in a bookshop in the town where I lived as an older child. But like the Land of Green Ginger itself, the book floated away somewhere while I wasn't paying attention, and only the fragrant memory remained. But then very recently I saw it in a local bookshop, and seized the moment to buy it again. 
 I understand that in the intervening years, an abridged version was published, which many people do not like, but the one I know and love is the 1966 version, reprinted again in 2015. Never having seen the shorter version, I cannot comment on what was left out, but the full story is well worth it. 
 In essence, The Land of Green Ginger picks up the story of Aladdin after he was married and living happily ever after. It's a sort of next-generation Aladdin, if you like, written in a gentle and delightful prose which draws you into the wide lands between China, Persia and Arabia - though geography is never really taken very seriously, and is certainly never a constraint on people's movements. 
 The villains are truly villainous, seeking nothing more than to deceive the innocent, and concocting wicked and apparently invincible plans for advancing their own cause. The good guys and girls, whether human, animal, or mythological are authentically good, though frequently absent-minded and careless. They bumble their way through a series of mishaps to successfully thwart the schemes of the wicked. The happy ending is never really in doubt, even though the obstacles continue to pile up until the very last chapter. 
 All in all it's a great book, whether you buy it to give to - or read to - a child, or just for your own pleasure."

 I've mentioned before about how my childhood was severely lacking in fictional bears. One of those bears was Paddington, from 'deepest, darkest Peru.' Husband loves Paddington Bear and spent weeks calling me Paddington after I bought a blue duffle-style coat. At husband's insistence the children's classic 'A Bear Called Paddington' by Michael Bond made it onto my Classics Club list. Turns out, it will be my first finish of the list too! After a particularly long day at work I curled up in bed and read it in one sitting. 
 I'm so glad I've rectified this missing part of childhood, because Paddington is adorable. From the moment that he fell into a saucer of tea on page 7 I was charmed (though utterly confused by his size, as apparently he is small enough to fall into a saucer of tea but big enough to come up to the waist of Judy Brown, who seems to be about 8 years old). The charm only continues. I found myself laughing out loud constantly and reciting bits of it back to husband. From dragging bacon around in his suitcase to nearly drowning in the bath Paddington is a bear with the biggest heart and the biggest knack for trouble. Michael Bond's writing is surprisingly witty and descriptive, making this the kind of book that children of all ages will laugh at. Peggy Fortnum's line drawing illustrations are gorgeous and simply add to the text. Paddington's character is very fully fleshed in comparison to many children's books of the era that I've stumbled upon - not only is he mischievous, but also thoughtful, a little stingy and has a very unsettling stare. 
 The setting is surprisingly undated. Although one does get a small impression that Paddington is in a Britain of yesteryear, all the settings will be familiar with todays readers, from Paddington station, to department store window displays and the havoc of the London underground. 
 There's not much else to say really. If you haven't read Paddington, dig it out and give him a try sometime. He's something quite special and definitely deserves his status as a classic children's character. 
 5 stars. I'll be going back for more."

Again, we follow Robert and Glenn on their adventures to solve the mysteries of Lovecraft Middle School. 
 As I have already read the first three books, I found that this one was slightly more predictable. Even the name of the enemy this time sounded evil; Miss Carcasse; and the picture on the cover gave it away a bit. 
 However, reading on I found that this story is just as inventive and strange as the first three in the series. Scary creatures and witty dialogue from these well-developed characters really bring the book to life and although I found the beginning quite slow, after the first three chapters, the rest of the book was mysterious and action-packed, as a good middle-grade novel should be. 
 Like the rest of the series before it, 'Substitute Creature' is full of mystery and although some parts were slightly predictable, I think that younger readers would still fall in love with it. 
 I stand by my previous opinion that this would make a great book for both boys and girls and the way the covers are so original and creative would make this series a great gift."

I am reading Caldecott winners (because duh) and I'm reading the complete works of Virginia Lee Burton. I think that this is my new favorite book of hers. 
 Burton's illustrations really make the book. The story is simple, and very similar to Mike Milligan (another Burton book). However, unlike Mike Milligan, this book was very engrossing to me. The borders of each page add to the story. They provide tiny details, like showing how the snow is rising around the city. I found myself spending more time reading the borders and being engrossed in the illustrations than reading the text. It was lovely. 
 I recommend this book to anyone who likes construction equipment, beautiful illustrations, and getting lost in the details."

It was comical, entertaining, action-packed and overall just a good, fun read. It is the first book in a new series. It is the story of the Intergalactic Bed and Breakfast, a nice little operation on the edge of the town of Forest Grove, Washington. It is at the end of a cul-de-sac right on the edge of wilderness. And for the two months of summer vacation, it will be the home of David 'Scrub' Elliott of Tampa Florida. And it is the last place David wants to be. He would prefer to be back home at basketball camp competing with his best friend. But instead, he has been dumped at his Grandma's quirky little inn. 
 But life for David is about to get much weirder than he ever expected. He states: ""Maybe it was Washington State. After all, this was over three thousand miles from home. And these people lived in the wilderness. Things were bound to be different here. And then there was Canada. We were only a few miles from the border. I didn't know much about Canadian culture, if there was such a thing. Maybe being so close, some of their customs had leaked across the international border, like osmosis."" p.20. But he really has no clue just how different. For even though the Bed and Breakfast is constantly full of guests, no one arrives on foot or via the front door of the bed and breakfast. All the guests arrive through transporters in the different rooms. Soon David is meeting and interacting with Aliens he could not even fathom from a book or movie. He is working hard with and for his Gram and really enjoying the responsibility. He has also found a girl in town he really likes, but he keeps messing things up as he tries to keep his Grandma's secret. To make matters worse, the girl's dad is the sheriff and he seems to have it out for David and his grandma. 
 The characters, both human and alien, are wonderful. The story has a great pace and is well written. The reader finds himself hoping and cheering for David as he grows through the summer at the inn. It was a great book that I can recommend to almost any reader and it will be enjoyed. But it might also be great for boys who do not read very much, for the story will draw them in and keep their attention. I, for one, am looking forward to the next tale in the series and hope it is the next of many more.

He mom disappears in depression and grief, her older sister retreats into her bedroom, and her dad has recently left the family to live in another state. Tara isn't sure what to do to pull them back together when something magical starts to happen. Butterflies appear and soon after a letter from Grammy Claire shows up. 
 The letter contains a mystery, a key and a clue to another letter. Tara discovers that Grammy Claire was afraid that her research on a tropical island had attracted the attention of someone who wanted to take it, someone who may be willing to cause her harm to get it. She calls on Claire to solve the mystery through a series of clues that will lead her to a solution that may protect something precious. 
 When the Butterflies Came by Kimberley Griffiths Little focuses on the importance family members play in our lives while weaving a tale of mystery and fantasy. Tara feels the importance that Grammy Claire has entrusted something significant to her. As she learns things about herself along the way, she also becomes determined to forge a stronger relationship with her sister and help her mother emerge from depression. 
 Readers aged 9 to 12 will find a lot to like in Tara's journey of self-discovery set along the bayous of Louisiana and the islands of Micronesia.

Drugged and placed in trunks, they wake to find a note telling them they are needed to fight an evil. 
 Harry, Artie and Billie are all very compelling characters with strong personalities with the friendship between the three being well defined and convincing. I was never confused as Nicholson explained earlier events from the first book, with the references and 'remember whens' being well explained without boring readers familiar with the first. 
 In this story, the action takes place in New Orleans, with the Order of the White Crow at the center of the mystery and strange events. Several possible villains appear, each with a plausible purpose and potential to be 'the' ringleader, and while several are dismissed, the arc works to keep readers guessing and discovering along with the readers. 
 Solid characterization, action galore and several villains that range from mildly to thoroughly nasty, the story has plenty to amuse. While I had some issues with historical accuracy of New Orleans of the day, this shouldn't be a huge hang up for the intended audience of middle-grade readers.

She hatches a fiendish plot, and with her slave troll, leaves her castle for the first time in ages. 
 French creates a pretty interesting fantasy world and put some fun bad guys in it, but then doesn't seem to know what to do with them. The good guys are deadly dull, and all the characters spend most of their time walking up and down this one road between two neighboring kingdoms. Which is not very exciting. Still, the cover and illustrations are awesome, and it's a good pick for smart kids in 4th grade who THINK they want something scary to read, but in fact are prone to nightmares.

 The book provides a 'Data Bank' of relevant facts about the time period you can refer to you when you want (and even a cheat sheet matching particular facts with relevant page numbers). So you get a bit of educational value and no surprise bad ends, but also a much more linear, less wild ride than other CYOA. It's also fun that you frequently slide back and forth within the time period you're assigned to, seeing characters at different ages, etc - you're zapping through time a *lot*.

They wear the shadows and chase the fireflies. They are the ones who etch the frost on your windows into delicate designs. They can be carried on the wind high above the rooftops and disappear when you try to glimpse them out your window. They scatter leaves on the yards and stretch webs across the doorways. They are the ones who steal parts of the moon each night too. But you, you awake at dawn just as they are disappearing. And you bring the light of the day with you. If you try hard too, you will see the last of the night children as you head off to school. 
 Tsiang's prose here reads like poetry. She uses such strong imagery throughout that she creates a nighttime world filled with magical moments. In her gathering darkness ""light spills in puddles on the pavement"" and the leaves the night children scatter are ""like toys on the lawn."" Each page has some special phrasing on it that adds to the wonder of this book. The writing is rich and surprising, just like the night itself. 
 Bodet's illustrations take Tsiang's imagery and brings it fully alive. The art is filled with a play of light and dark. The puddles of light glow on the pavement as actual puddles catch the last of the sun's rays. Stolen pieces of the moon glow in small hands as the night children dance across the roof with their prize. When the day comes, the light is warm and bright, glowing on the page and filled with bright color. The night colors contrast with that, more rich and deep and mysterious. 
 A poetic and lovely book, this is a luminous bedtime story. Appropriate for ages 3-5."

Now Jasper has been rescued by Animals Asia, an animal welfare organization. He is taken to their Moon Bear Rescue Center where his medical needs are attended to and he is put into the sanctuary. There, Jasper walks on grass for the first time in his life. Caregivers work to teach Jasper how to find food on his own, hiding food in toys and places to dig. In time, Jasper's life starts to change. He begins to play more, get stronger, and make friends. Jasper is one success story among many, a testament to what rescue can do to save animals that might have been considered too damaged to rescue. 
 Robinson and Bekoff write in a very engaging way in this nonfiction picture book. They invest time in telling the story of the abuse as well as painting a beautiful picture of moon bears in the wild: ""Far away in the mist-covered mountains of China, the moon sends yellow arcs of light across the hills, softly painting the forests with a luminous glow."" They describe the way that wild animals sleep with a sense of freedom. The prose is beautiful, clearly painting the value of these animals and the importance of their rescue and rehabilitation. 
 The illustrations are equally evocative. The paintings have a wonderful sense of place, showing the workers at the sanctuary and the horror of the small cages with equal attention. I particularly like the way that the opening image relates to that at the end, showing that Jasper is once again more like the wild moon bears than the abused ones. 
 A great book on the importance of animal rehabilitation and rescue, this book will speak volumes to every child who picks it up and meets Jasper. Appropriate for ages 7-9."

Unfortunately, he didn't love school with all of its rules, so he was homeschooled by Fraulein, his nanny, until he went to high school. Paul grew famous for his math but he still could not take care of himself and do his own laundry, cook his meals or even butter his own bread. So when at age 21 he was invited to go to England to work on his math, he was worried about whether he could do it. It turned out that buttering bread was not that difficult and that he would follow his own sort of lifestyle that ignored the rules. So he traveled and did math around the world, staying with fellow mathematicians and relying on them to take care of him and his laundry and his meals. He was the furthest thing from a stereotypical solitary mathematician to the point that people now have an ""Erdos number"" that shows how closely they worked with the amazing mathematician Paul Erdos. 
 This is such a wonderful biography. It is a breath of fresh air in so many ways. First, it plays against the stereotype of introverted and shy mathematicians working in solitude on formulas and instead shows Erdos as a vivacious man who didn't just work with others, but depended on them. Second, it shows mathematics as ever changing and new, something that is enticing and exciting. Heiligman uses a light tone throughout as well as an obvious respect for Erdos' brilliance and accomplishments. 
 The illustrations share the same playful feel of the text. Done in bold colors and dynamic motion, they have a humor that is welcome as well. The look on Erdos' face as he tries to butter his own bread for the first time is priceless and wonderful. Children will be amazed that such a bright man would struggle with basic tasks. 
 A pleasure to read, this is an unusual biography that will make a welcome addition to nonfiction shelves. Appropriate for ages 6-9."

Different people gather under the baobab at different times. Sometimes the market wagon is there selling pots, pans and cloths. Other times, the elders are gathered there talking. Sometimes it's a storyteller sharing stories. As the children walk to the tree, they see all sorts of wildlife like weaver birds, gazelle, and a termite mound. The siblings reach the baobab tree and more and more people join them, along with the minister and his Bible for church under the tree.

The other two books in the series are Time for a Bath (coming in May) and Time to Sleep (just released). In this book, readers learn about the many strange and different things that animals eat. From the rocks that an ostrich has to eat to chew its food to the tapping thin fingers of an aye-aye looking for lunch, the facts are fascinating. 
 Those facts are paired with Jenkins' illustrations done in paper collage. As always, his collage work captures the texture of fur, the softness of feathers, and the smoothness of skin. They manage to be simple yet demonstrate the complexity of the animals. 
 Make sure to turn to the end of the book for more details about the featured animals. The facts included in the body of the book read aloud very well, offering just enough detail to be interesting and yet to move along quickly. 
 This is a great book to add to any library's nature section and to keep on hand for any nature or animal story times you will be doing. The dung beetle alone is sure to get children intrigued! Appropriate for ages 4-7."

There is a cricket, a frog, a mouse, a snake, and a bird. After Catkin pounces them they disappear from view. But sharp-eyed readers will be able to spy them hiding. Finally, Catkin climbs a tree to catch a bird, but goes too high. Now it is Amy's job to find Catkin in the garden and rescue him! 
 The first thing you will notice about this book is its amazing illustrations. Done in an almost Slavic motif, they are rich, deep colored and stylized. As Catkin pounces an animal it appears in the yellow and red border, adding another layer to this book. Lord's text is brief and invites young readers to participate in the seeking and finding of the animals. Readers will enjoy spotting not only the animals in the text, but also insects and other animals. 
 A richly illustrated seek-and-find book that is perfect for the youngest listeners. I would suggest using this with only a very small group, because the pleasure of the book is to look closely at the illustrations and talk about them. Appropriate for ages 2-4."

 I had the opportunity to meet the author during the 2015 NCTE Convention. Hearing her explain the inspiration for this tale made me want to pick up this book ASAP.

However, Pham's thoughtful, nuanced, and mathematically-enriched illustrations made this an amazing read."

Firstly, I think she did a good job in her reading although I have listened to other books read by actors and enjoyed their portrayals far more. It still was an enjoyable listen for me though. 
 The story of Peter Pan strikes me as being similar to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland due to its strange way of how the story is told. However, I enjoyed Peter Pan much more than I enjoyed the previous mentioned. I liked the way that the author took us on the journey with the Darling kids and Peter Pan and his lost boys. The interjection of the narrator into the storyline would always anchor the story and bring the listener/reader back into the reality of the kids' situation. It was fun to listen to how Wendy touched everyone's lives and how they played house and related to each other. The ending was a little bittersweet for me and made me anxious for the future children while also being sweet to see the traditions continue. 
 Bottom line is that it is a fun childhood read that even teenagers and adults can enjoy if they're in the whimsical mood. 
 Likes: The characters. Neverland. Wendy playing Mother. The tradition continuing in the end. 
 Dislikes: A little hard to follow and the children's lives seemed pretty strange before Peter took them (although I know it's meant to be comical). 
 Overall: 
 Recommend? Yes."

I managed to read a few Bobsey Twin books, Box Car Children, Laura Ingalls, The Littles, Betsy-Tacy, and Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle, Anne of Greene Gables, but never Nancy Drew. I guess I missed out! Anyway, I got to enjoy my first book with my daughter who after seeing the Nancy Drew movie a few months ago has become a huge fan. 
 Because these books were written in the 50s (30s? - my book says 30s but would a girl have had her own blue convertible in the 30s?), I had to talk to my children why things are different today. We talked about how she didn't have a cell phone to call for help or report the robbers immediately. We also talked about stranger-danger and how back in the 50s Nancy could do some things such as not telling people where she was going that is not wise by today's standards. WE also had to mention that Nancy didn't have a Garmin to tell her where she was while was driving - she had to use her instinct and a map! 
 I hope my daughter wants to read the next book in this series!"

Yes, it's YA, but who doesn't like a quick YA read once in a while just for fun...me?

 Dean Seaborne is a boy pirate. Though he would give anything to have a normal life, he is a pirate spy for Old-Eyed Jack, king of the pirates. His attempt to leave the pirate life has caused him to be sent to the ship of Gentleman Jim whose crew is all children. Dean is tasked with finding out why Gentleman Jim is so well liked and why he is behind on his cut to the king of pirates. Dean dreads being a spy this time, especially when he wishes he could remain on Jim's ship. Jim truly IS a gentleman pirate. He governs his crew through a code of conduct and fairness AND he has given Dean a second chance after he tries to talk his way on board by claiming to be the prince of Zenhala. Jim is too wise to believe the fable of a ""hidden"" country within the Bermuda Triangle that lives in peace and harmony and whose ships come and go only once a year, trading their goods and the gold that grows on tress. Legend has it that nearly 13 years ago one pirate broke through and stole all the gold plus kidnapped the prince after killing the queen and leaving the king a broken man through grief. Rumor has it that Zenhalan ships are scouting for the prince and that they have zeroed in on his whereabouts. 
 Dean quickly learns that Gentleman Jim's pirate code is the reason for Dean being sent to spy on him. But the longer Dean works with the child-crew the more he desires to stay. Unfortunately, Dean is not the only pirate spy on board and soon Gentleman Jim and their ship is in danger. As the ship sinks, Dean takes leadership and struggles against the sabotage of the other spy even when they are all rescued by a Zahalan ship that claims Dean truly IS the missing prince. 
 This sets into motion new task as a spy for the pirate king, but as events unfold, and Dean must prove himself as the prince/heir it seems his wish to be free of One-Eyed Jack can come true and that he IS the missing prince. But is he really? Or is he some sort of decoy? IF he is, can he survive the tests and scheming of the Zahalans who wish him to remain lost? Whether he is or he isn't, can he have the future he has always dreamed of? 
 The high-action plot will keep readers guessing as to the outcome AND entertained the entire way. The first in a new series, I cannot wait to read Dean's next adventure. I also cannot wait to see the reaction to SEABORNE 1: THE LOST PRINCE in my workshops. Thank you Matt Myklusch for an excellent example of engaging writing for middle grade readers"

Colour is used well in paintings that depict colours to convey mood. There's not a lot of story but this is still for older children who have a firmer grasp on their emotions. It could segwey well into an expressive art project and lead to participatory conversations on feelings.

 This is a exciting adventure, with pirates, a fabled island where gold grows on trees, trials to prove worthiness of royal, and pirate battle. You don't want to stop reading. You can never guess where the story is going to go next. It is also a clean read. 
 The characters are a good mix of bad guys you hate, bad guys that you love to root for and some you just love. Dean Seaborne is the main character that the story centers around. 
 Dean is 13 year old. He tried running away from the Pirate King. He is almost fed to the sharks. 
 He is given one more chance to find out why Gentleman Jim has been sending less money to him. 
 Dean gets taken on with Gentleman Jim. He is only their a short time but his ways rub off on Dean. 
 One-Eyed Jack the Pirate king. He is feared by plenty. The pirates pay him a tithe. He does not care who he hurts or kills. 
 Gentleman Jim Harper captain of the Reckless. He only robs those who can afford it. His crew are all children. He does not harm anyone if he can help it. They scare them. Most of his crew are loyal. 
 Ronan is first mate on the Reckless. He is smart, big and does not give up. 
 The setting for this book is the Caribbean and Bermuda Triangle. 
 The adventure draws you in from the first chapter. The story is fast paced. It is creative. I liked the sea monsters or at least one of them. 
 Dean's life is at risk for most of the book. Some of his enemies are known others you are not sure of till they are revealed. 
 The target audience is 8 to 12 years old. I think a lot more will like it. I loved it and I am a lot older. My 23 year old daughter loved it too. I think fans of Ranger Apprentice, Percy Jackson, Brotherband, and Harry Potter will like it too. 
 I was given this ebook to read by Net Galley and Egmont USA. In return I agreed to give honest review of it."

 This book is so sweet, and I think it would be perfect for kids who love legendary creatures and animals in general. The book is told in really cute rhymes, which I think are always enjoyable for kids...heck, not just kids - I love rhymes too! 
 Part of what I love about this book is its message - to appreciate the things you have. We always think the grass is greener on the other side, but everything has its pros and cons, and sometimes it's just better to appreciate and cherish what you have. 
 Something I found interesting is that the text is bigger in some places to show emphasis, and it gets smaller when a character is whispering. I think this is such a great idea because if you're reading out loud to your child, you know exactly how to read it in a more dramatic and entertaining way for them! 
 I absolutely love the illustrations. They're so beautiful and I think their whimsical looks pair perfectly with the mythical creatures subject matter! 
 All in all, this is a great book for young kids, especially little dreamers who love fantasy and all the creatures you can possibly imagine."

 I love hearing more about Erdos, who I really only knew of via the Erdos number (which pre-dates the more commonly known Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon). And while he sounds odd in the scheme of the general world (his life, habits, etc)., he sounds strangely familiar in a geeky way. I mean, I thought A Beautiful Mind was not weird or shocking but rather familiar (in the context having grown up near and around MIT). There are people like this, and I am excited to see that there is a book that describes people like this in an even-handed way... 
 In other words, it gives me hope that this might be shared children who's interests and habits might be out of the 'norm' and that it enables us all (parents and society) to think about alternative manners of being... 
 Oh and most definitely read the author and illustrator's notes. Very important--at least for adult readers."

When I was a child my parents signed up for a book-of-the-month club with Disney and Dr. Seuss. Each month I would receive a book from each club in the mail. I loved it! But, the Seuss club was seriously lacking in the well-known books like Green Eggs and Ham and The Lorax, sadly. 
 The Lorax is an unmistakable advertisement for environmentalism. The Once-ler takes over the world with the Truffula Trees and destroys it making his Sneeds, ignoring the pleas of the Lorax. Despite the obvious intent, it still holds up to Seussian standards: the silly, nonsensical words and the colorful drawings make it another of his lovely children's books. Reading Dr. Seuss books as an adult brings back memories of being an innocent, impressionable child. Anything is possible when you're a kid, and reading these books helps to bloom that feeling again. Even in cynical adults like me."

The author has captured the trials and struggles of a non-native English speaker moving to the US and being thrust into American culture. I know many Japanese that come to live temporarily in my area and even though they've studied English, I am more aware of how many things I say that are slang and they don't understand. I'm also trying to learn a bit of Japanese and teach them English when they ask for translations. It really makes me take a fresh look at all the ""rules"" we have and how ridiculous it can get to try to remember them. Japanese is so much more straightforward. 
 The author has created an authentic 10 year old voice that readers will come to love and care about as she shares her fears in letter format to her Grandma. And of course, with all the ""rules"" there is plenty of humor too."

 --------------- 
 In the first story, Katie's class is getting a class pet. But, what will that pet be? Each student wants a different animal. What will the teacher choose? 
 The teacher choose a guinea pig, and the class names it Binky. Each weekend, the teacher takes Binky home. But, one weekend, she cannot take it home, so one of the students will have to. Who will she choose? 
 Of course, she choose our heroine, Katie Woo. Katie takes Binky home, and the unthinkable happens.... Binky runs off while Katie is using the bathroom. Will she be able to explain this to the rest of the class? 
 Katie goes to school in tears, ready to face the inevitable, and just as she starts to tell the teacher she lost Binky, she feels something warm sliding out of her backpack and up against her neck. Guess who's back! 
 ----------------- 
 In the second story, an annoying classmate named Roddy Rogers keeps teasing Katie. He teases her in the classroom. He teases her at recess. He teases her at lunch. He teases her on the way home. 
 But, Katie has discovered a way to stop Roddy's teasing. She'll just ignore it, and act as if it does not bother her at all. And, it works perfectly! 
 ----------------- 
 In the third story, Katie's classmate, Jake's toy airplane comes up missing. He's really sad about this, because a relative gave it to him for his birthday recently. 
 It's obvious from the stupid excuses Katie keeps making that she took the toy. But, how will she find a way to return it to Jake? 
 Katie gets up to use the pencil sharpener, and she places it carefully on the windowsill, then says that it must have flown in during recess. She returns it to Jake, and whispers that she had taken it, but felt the need to return it. Of course, Jake is mad at Katie at first. But, he calms down, and tells her that he is just glad that she has returned it to him. 
 ---------------- 
 In the fourth--and final!--story, Katie's class is putting on a class production of the play, *The Princess and the Frog*. This is nothing like the Disney version with Princess Tiana that kids know nowadays. And, the four main parts are: a princess, a prince, a tree, and a worm. Guess which part Katie Woo gets! 
 Katie is devastated that she has been chosen to play a worm in the play. What's so special about a worm? How can Katie stand out as a worm? Why can't she be the beautiful Princess instead? 
 But, she makes a real splash in the actual performance, telling the Frog that she--the worm--will kiss him if he doesn't allow the Princess to kiss him. Turns out that he allows it, and all goes well, thanks to Katie the Worm.

 This was provided to me as an eARC/DRC via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest review. All opinions expressed here are my own. 
 I would definitely read more *Katie Woo* stories. They are short and cute, so adorable. Also, I think that all children would enjoy them, as would parents, since they all have a moral and teach you something admirable."

Noting that author Jacqueline Davies had previously penned the Lemonade War series my snobbish side came out in full force. Passing Lemonade Mouth (aka Puckered Lips?) on the shelves I didn't even give it a second glance. Fortunately, I opted to give Nothing But Trouble a go and was richly rewarded. 
 Charming, relatable main characters, Maggie and Lena, take on middle school through a series of highly sophisticated ""hacks"" leaving the whole school on its toes. Wholesome but not in a overly saccharine Brady Bunch way. As an added bonus there is quite a bit of science involved in their clever schemes which certainly awakened my interests in a subject I've sometimes written off as dull. 
 Would make a terrific choice for girls not of the fantasy/sci-fi ilk but not yet gearing up for pre-teen romance either. Laws of physics explained in an engaging manner at the back of the book. 
 I just may be puckering up for some Lemonade after all."

Sam, Joey, and Roger put together a plan to follow this map to find clues and more, but they don't expect the danger that trails them around every corner. 
 I read this aloud with one of my sons and he really enjoyed tagging along on this adventure. There are quite a few twists and turns that catch a reader off guard. It's later revealed that these boys are around 11 years old. I have a daughter who is 11 and I can't imagine her and her friends embarking on something as crazy as this escapade at this age, but it's very fun to pretend and imagine. That's one this book is really good at--sparking imagination and drawing the reader into the experience. It's easy to put yourself in place of one of the characters. 
 The book wraps up, but there is an open end, leaving a small window in the plot for another story to come through in the future. This is a fun fantasy adventure that most middle grade readers will enjoy.

 Will he unearth somethings that are unforgivable? 
 Mia is one of the strongest female characters I have ever met and Adam!... Oh my, Adam will take your breath away and you will fall in love....again

The premise of this book is that a boy's friend tells him that Santa isn't real. The boy stays awake to try and listen for Santa, The boy then ends up a train that takes him and other children to the North Pole. This train is called the Polar Express. While at the North Pole, the children encounter elves and factories and see all of the toys for Christmas being made. The boy is then chosen by Santa to be the child to receive the first gift of Christmas. For his gift, the boy wants something that will help him always believe in Santa and he is gifted with a silver bell from the reindeer's harness. Unfortunately, he loses the bell and is devastated! However, when he opens his gifts on Christmas he finds a present from Santa with the bell in it. He and his sister can hear it, but his parents think it is broken. The book ends with the boy growing up and his sister and friends not being able to hear the bell anymore. However, he still can. 
 This is a beautiful story with equally beautiful images. The movie definitely did not do this story, especially the ending justice.There are many editions available of this book. There is a library edition, which is HUGE, but if you have a lot of children or grandchildren, I'd recommend it so that you can have the children gather around you to listen and everyone can see the images. There is also a 30th anniversary edition that comes with downloadable audio of Liam Neeson reading the story. I honestly figured it'd be Tom Hanks reading it, but Neeson is great too. This is a story for children who are on the cusp of not believing or who may have friends trying to take the magic of Christmas from them. Highly recommend."

This book is a wonderful reminder of the imagination and fun of pre-teen years in which nighttime in the neighborhood promises independence, adventure and a place to expand your boundaries. Molly is discovering her way with a father who works the night shift and her overly-anxious and obedient neighbor Noah. Together they evade the adults to ride the Night Train, where they indulge in the freedom to eat and play on their terms. As Molly follows her heart, she also has to face her fears. 
 I loved this story. Molly is both a rebel and a girl in need with whom many kids can relate. The book takes place in just a short amount of time, allowing the author to delve into the setting and description of this quaint island community, the intertwined relationships and Molly's unresolved conflicts. Although it is a full-length middle grade novel, the compressed time-table made it feel like a captivating short story. It's a book I'd love to share with my nieces and nephews ages 8-12."

For me it was loopy earrings, banana clips, the girls with the perfect perms and spiked bangs. Not to mention, the social clicks, health class, and the giggles when a boy talked to you. Diary of a Wimpy Kid is laugh out loud funny. Jeff Kinney reminds me of those days in middle school and by the lives of my own 11, and two 13year olds not much has changed. Kinney has brought these awkward years much needed comic relief through cartoons and Gregg Heffley, a middle school student who becomes the unlikely hero. Greg really lays it out for us in his ""journal"" from his mom volunteering as a sub teacher to girls (because he really does like them). One of my favorite parts was when Greg tried out for the school play in Wizard of Oz. He really wanted to be the tree for two reasons: 1. It didn't have any speaking parts and 2: He was hoping he could throw apples at Dorthy. But then again all the middle school boys wanted to be trees. I can't wait until my sons read this book. It will be interesting to see their take. Funny!"

It is beautifully written, especially at the beginning and the relationship between the orphaned Sophie and Charles, her foster parent, is beautifully and tenderly drawn. Charles is a lovely, quirky character and I defy anyone not to become fond of him. 
 It is however very much a book of two halves and I did struggle with the rather abrupt change when Sophie and Charles head for Paris. I found her antics in the second half of the book a little unbelievable. Perhaps if there had been more of a lead in it would have helped. The ending was quite abrupt and left me feeling slightly dissatisfied. For me another chapter was definitely needed. Without wishing to sound picky and this is purely with my writer's hat on, I also wasn't that keen on the cover or the title. For those two reasons it's probably not a book I would have picked up off the shelf in a shop and bought without recommendation. However I'm very glad that someone lent it to me and I would definitely recommend it."

This is, of course, depending on the reading levels, but Chand/Shaw do a good job making this pretty clean. I think with a good reader that helps bridge any understanding gaps, this could be as early as 3. 
 Art: The art is clean and not too distracting for the young mind (a theme across the board for Chand/Shaw combo). 
 Writing: The sentences are short and fast, which is good to have in a children's book like this. 
 Plot/Setting: The Sherlock Holmes style is a great start basis for a story. With most people already being familiar with S. H., it acts as a shoe-in into the world Chand/Shaw are creating. This really sets up for a lengthy series using these two characters. There are a number of adventures they could go on. I hope to see that one day. 
 Characters: In line with the plot/setting, I think that the characters are easy to identify with. 
 Overall: I think this was a quick, easy read. I think it offers enough challenge for the young reader (maybe a word or two) but enough excitement and mystery to have the reader want to read on through it. I think any writing that gets a child interested in reading is good writing, but more to the point, I think that these Bird Brain Books are establishing a brand, which is a good and reliable thing to have."

Written for young children, the writing is simple and would easily suit early readers. There are passages of nice description and the plot is easy to follow. 
 I enjoyed the world building - the dragons in particular were engaging and included some interesting detail. 
 On the other hand, I found the characters of the children harder to engage with. While we are given a very brief introduction to them in the beginning, as a reader, I would have liked a little more time getting to know them and understand their relationships before jumping straight into the action. Although, younger readers might not be so concerned. 
 The pacing of the novel was fast and well suited to its audience. Some plot points were a little convenient (or occasionally unbelievable) and, while I know that younger readers are less likely to be critical of this, there were times that these pulled me out of the book. 
 This was a novel with real potential that just lacked a little fluency. The author has some really creative ideas and there were hints of backstory that left me incredibly intrigued."

The children will also have to contend with a Zebedia, a male dragon, whose love, a female dragon named Sciathie, has been cursed by the evil Merradagh, and many other dangers and obstacles the will have to overcome if they hope to return home. 
 The author's writing makes the book an easy and enjoyable read and soon draws you into the story. 
 The created world is well described and atmospheric, as are the characters. 
 The book is aimed at children starting from 8/9 and upwards, but also enjoyable by those much older. 
 This is an ideal and exciting coming of age story that children will love to read.

On the cover, there is the brown bear looking to the right, waiting to see what's in the book. The title is printed on the bear's body in white. Once open the book, you can see the endpages are printed in horizontal lines in nine different colors. In the front matter, there is also a short introduction of The Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art. It shows how well known and impactful the illustrator is. Almost all of the pictures are double page spread pictures on a clear, white background, so the focus is entirely on the pictures of the animals. The text is printed rather small on the corner. On the right side of the pages, the text always tells what the animals see, indicating the next animal that is going to show. At the end, it there are children who see all of the animals and the teacher. So while readers are reading about these animals, the children in the book are also seeing what the readers see. And it also takes the readers back to review everything they see in the book by listing everything in the last page. What is also interesting is that the children drawn in the picture are in different skin colors. So the readers are exposed to the topic of ethnicity."

She follows it into a rabbit hole but instead of finding the animal, she falls a long way into a strange hallway. Without a way back up, her only lead is the bottle labelled ""drink me"" -- and drinking it is just the beginning of her adventure. 
 When Alice went off after the white rabbit, she hoped for something more exciting than her older sister's book. She didn't expect to find herself in another world where there seems to be no rules and every inhabitant is odd to say the least. 
 A sip from a bottle makes Alice shrink while a bite from a cake makes her grow. Cats can disappear and flamingos work as croquet mallets. Everyone is a bit -- or more -- mad, including the Queen who's only way of ruling is to order executions. 
 Alice is curious about this new land of wonders and certainly not afraid to speak her mind despite the weirdness around her. Her ultimate goal is to get back home but to accomplish that, she first needs to survive a pool of her own tears, a mad tea party and trial for stolen tarts, to name a few. 
 This was a wonderfully bizarre book full of nonsense. Even though I knew some parts of the story in advance, it was fun to experience it from beginning to end. It's definitely a children's book but I enjoyed it even as an adult. 
 The story is told from Alice's perspective and it really felt like a child's point of view, even though the actual writing and wording was quite clever. I found Alice a bit bratty and rude at times, but she was also brave. 
 What I didn't like was the ending. But I don't want to spoil it, so let's leave it at that. 
 Everyone knows this is a classic and the story includes numerous quotes that are popular even today. New adaptations pop up every now and then, and knowing the original story helps appreciate all the new twists and turns. 
 Alice's Adventures in Wonderland doesn't go to the top of my favorites list but I liked it. It's very short (under 100 pages!) so you should definitely give it a go at some point."

 Kelly Ferguson wants nothing more than to go to Camp Miskatonic. Her parents aren't amazingly well off, so she's worked a lot of odd pre-teen jobs in order to afford the fee. Today, she's decided to give her best shot at babysitting. But Kelly doesn't know the monsters under the bed are real. Worst of all, the kid she's babysitting can make nightmares come to life, and the Boogeyman is out for revenge. 
 I didn't really get into this until about 150 pages in. The plot was a bit slow starting out and took a minute to grab me, but it definitely got more interesting near the end. I also think I would've liked this more if the illustrations were available (FYI I read an advanced reader's copy that didn't have any interior art), so I may update this review and add a star once I see the art. 
 I think kids will like the plot, it's engaging and kinda feels like a mixture of two Disney Channel original movies (Adventures in Babysitting mashed with Girl VS. Monster). Our main character is a girl but boys will certainly be into this, and especially any kid who enjoys ""gross"" things. The author of this book writes some AMAZINGLY gross descriptions. I'm talking smells, snot, loogies, slime . . . the writing was genuinely gag-worthy, but in a way you can't deny is well done!"

 From its first line, 'On the morning of its first birthday, a baby was found floating in a cello case in the middle of the English Channel', Katherine Rundell's Rooftoppers is the sort of book that demands that you step right inside it. 
 Sophie is that baby; her mother presumed drowned. She is a particular child, a brave little 'mother hunter' who is sweeter than she knows. Rescued by Charles ('think of ink if ink had vocal chords') she is brought up to be absolutely herself even if that self draws on walls, wears incorrect clothes and banquets in a most irregular fashion. Charles's parenting (for such it is) is rich with love and intelligence but falls short of the standards of the English social services and in time Charles, Sophie and the cello case (with its Paris label their only clue) are on the run. Again authority is the enemy; once the Paris police too are on the hunt for Sophie the streets are unsafe. But in this magical book it would be pedestrian to stay at street level: the author takes us onto the rooftops and high in the trees where there are children who live movingly hard lives but who 'in exchange have the sky'. These children accept and help Sophie in what seems to be a hopeless task to find her mother. And wise Charles stands aside to let Sophie be led by her peers - even into danger, 'Keep your secret...Everybody needs them. Secrets make you tough, and wily.' The children are strongly drawn, not just Sophie but Matteo (equal parts vulnerable and brave) and the supporting cast, beautiful Anastasia and Safi ('sky-treaders', strangely dignified in their rags) and Gerard the strange tall thin boy who hears every whisper and lives in the bell tower of Notre Dame. The ending is everything that it should be - I won't say more for fear of spoiling it. 
 Katherine Rundell has created a world that is a strange but convincing blend of fairytale and harsh truth. A beautifully depicted world where you should 'never ignore a possible'. 
 Rooftoppers is a very special book."

Alison just wants to get along with everyone and manages it by being herself. Later in the book she has a family challenge of her own to get through. Rachel struggles with being intelligent and her self assurance is no where near as confident as her school work.

 Title: Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What do You See? 
 Author: Bill Martin Jr. 
 Illustrator: Eric Carle 
 Genre: Predictable picture book 
 Theme(s): Animals, colors, Predictable text, 
 Opening line/sentence (type directly from text): 
 ""Brown Bear, Brown Bear, what do you see? I see a red bird looking at me."" 
 Brief Book Summary (2-3 sentences in your own words): 
 In this book, the reader reads about different animals and things they see. Each page starts out in a predictable way. An animal is asked what they see and they say ""I see a ____ looking at me!"". The animals are also somewhat predictable because they are always described with a color preceding their name. The book ends with students talking about what they see (using the same form of predictable text) and they see all the animals that were previously listed, which gives children a chance to repeat everything back. 
 Professional Recommendation/Review #1 (cut & paste, details below): 
 The Hornbook Guide: 
 Martin, Bill, Jr. and Carle, Eric Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? 
 26pp. pp. Holt 1992. ISBN 0-8050-1744-5 
 (2) K-3 series. Reissue:, 1967. The contemporary classic has been reissued with text restored from the original version and with new illustrations based on the originals. As before, Carle's large, brilliantly colored animals set against a white background make the book perfect for sharing with a group of preschoolers, while Martin's repetitious text is eminently chantable and gives a boost to beginning readers.

 Mary Jane from BookHive (bookhive.org) says 
 ""Martin's gentle rhythmic text: ""Brown bear, brown bear what do you see?"" combined with Eric Carle's colorful full- page collage illustrations, encourages even toddlers to chime in with the reader. This well-loved classic is a great concept book of colors and animals.""

 Response to Two Professional Reviews (3-4 sentences in your own words) 
 I agree with both of the professional reviews that this book is excellent, especially with readers exhibiting fluent reading-like behavior. The predictability in the text makes it easy for children to reproduce the book on their own and the simplicity of the illustrations make it easy for young children to interpret them on their own. Both reviewers pointed that this book is perfect for preschoolers, and I would also use this book with preschoolers and maybe kindergartners as well. 
 Evaluation of Literary Elements (3-4 sentences in your own words): 
 I always loved books that Eric Carle wrote or illustrated when I was a child because the predictability of the text and the simple drawings that were easy for me to interpret as a young child (I also had little patience so they were easy for me to look at quickly). There were minimal colors used on each page, which follows Molly Bang's ideas in Picture This that only three colors are necessary for emotional impact. Carle has a little more than three colors, but he uses them effectively. This book would tie in well with curriculum on animals, and could be used as a great way to introduce the unit. I would extend the unit afterwards by having children make their own page in the book, and we would discuss the predictable text together, so they could make their page in the same style. Having children make their own pages in the book using their favorite animals would also help me plan a unit on animals, because I would learn which animal is their favorite. This book could also be used for a unit on colors."

 The four-year old is big into rhyme at the moment, so the rhyming text was a success. He also likes anything with wheels and he'd never seen anything resembling the quirky tiny houses. It was also good when he got to see the hammers and saws used to change the farmhouse into a house on wheels. 
 Tiny house goes on his adventures around America, stopping at New Orleans, Texas and the Rocky mountains. Grandson liked the maps and the place names didn't phase him - I don't suppose he would have known British places so they made no difference. 
 There was slightly too much writing to keep the attention of my two-year old grand-daughter. but she enjoyed looking at the pictures and shouted 'Beep Beep' every time she spotted Tiny House. 
 The pictures are gorgeous and there was lots of detail for us to look at and talk about. 
 This is an unusual and fun book with an important message about the meaning of home.

I wanted to read it because I love Alice in Wonderland (the old and new movies) and so I wanted to read the original. It is a little different from the movie. I'm on the sequel now, Through The Looking Glass, and I'm noticing that the original Disney movie took parts from each book. It was amusing, but Lewis Carroll's style of writing is hard to follow at times, obviously. Especially since it was written so long ago. The main theme of the book is the deconstruction of meaning and the rationality of thought. Basically, it's nonsense! But fun non-sense, but I don't see how this was meant to be a kid's book."

The mood is calm and relaxing so it's great at bedtime. It has a sweet message of kindness and giving. The illustrations are just amazing. I think why it's easy to re-read this book is because there are new things to talk about each time. For instance, the old man uses a water pump so I told my kids how their great-grandparents used to get their water like this. The little dog has a mustache, is another fun detail. And some of the bushes look like they have faces (my kids had to show that one to ME). Another special detail is the little old man gives thanks before he eats his meal.

 http://mauiehernando.booktrib.com/reviews/aliens-on-vacation/ 
 Scrub was hoping for a summer of intense basketball practices in time for him to take a spot in their school's starting line-up when September rolls around. But his busy parents had other things in mind. Instead of having him laze around in the house or play hoops, he was sent to his grandma's place in Forest Grove, Washington. Upon arriving at the Intergalactic Bed & Breakfast, he did not only meet a peace-loving grandmother who must have come straight from the 60's but also a host of rather unusual characters that are staying on as the B and B's guests. Naturally, Scrub's curiosity was piqued when Mr. Harnox, an impossibly tall and skinny gentleman with a grayish tinge, ate an aluminum foil without blinking (it was the aluminum foil eating, not the non-blinking that tipped him). So his grandma had to come clean with exactly what kind of business she's running. Grandma Sunshine (or Venus Mae if you'd rather) has been a long time operator of transporters - portals used by non-Earthlike creatures when crossing galaxies. But this year, Scrub's grandma is not only burdened with the usual requests and oddities from vacationers. The small town is becoming curious as to what is really going on inside the inn. If they find out, it could mean the end for Scrub's grandma's golden career as a hotelier for vacationing aliens. But not while Scrub has a say in it. With aplomb, ingenuity and sheer bravery, Scrub proved his merit, met new friends, broadened his horizons so to speak, and even kissed an amazing girl before summer's end (eat that, Tyler Sandusky!) 
 I was sure I would like Clete Barrett Smith's 
 Aliens on Vacation 
 . First off, the cover is simply adorable. The art is inviting, kid-friendly, and best of all, it doesn't alienate anyone. Second, it's a children's book so a guaranteed fun for me. 
 Scrub was having a difficulty at first in coming to terms with his being sent to a rural town when he could have improved his shooting techniques. His resentment at his parents for the last-minute arrangement was quite understandable. If I were in his place, I would feel the same. What I had a problem though was Scrub's inability to do a task as responsibly as possible in the first part of the book. His grandma made him in-charge of some things so I cringed whenever Scrub bungled them. Plus, it seemed a tad weird how Scrub's grandma didn't explain to him about the aliens right off the bat. They both could have avoided a lot of frustrations and embarrassment. But I guess it was all part of the plot. Because in time, Scrub did shine (haha...pun intended). It was marvelous to see his transformation from a resentful teenager to a much more responsible and conscientious kid. I am not usually a fan of books featuring aliens but this one I like really well. It was fun to see the aliens exploring earth and causing mischief whenever they can. 
 Aliens on Vacation 
 is a well-rounded book which featured characters that are real and situations that exploited and tested their abilities. It's a wonderful and fast-enough read I would recommend to kids, young adults and also to parents who might like to read about how children who are given the right amounts of love and discipline could mature when exposed to the right circumstances."

I love the rhythm and rhyme, it is just a fun book to read. And yet it also explores environmental consequences in a way that children can understand and ask questions about. It is a great foray into critical thinking and exploring how a book can apply to the real world."

 I loved this book and downloaded it to my kindle to read to my local children's reading group, where I volunteer. The book is geared to young readers and their parents but even my 10 year olds loved hearing this one. I highly recommend it!"

 If I was still a child, I'm sure I would love this book. Obviously, it's not written with the highest quality (and that's why it has received an somewhat unfair 3 stars), but more than that I feel that this book is sort of setting up the story. I know there is 9 books (with 10th coming out in less than a week) and I know they are 3 different trilogies, but as a starting point, this does a good job of setting things up...it just jumps real fast. That is both endearing for someone like me who just wanted some cheap, fun read (I did read this in basically a day), but also frustrating when you want more from some of the characters. 
 Furthermore, I hope that Twig develops a little more as he grows in the coming books. I plan on finishing off his trilogy this week, and we'll see if I get to the other 6-7 books in the future, but at least I'll do the Twig saga. He's a likable character, but somewhat boring. The meat and potatoes are obviously all the other creatures created within the world. 
 It's fun, it's a good kids book, but it could definitely be better."

This is not the sort of question he normally asks so it was great to have quite a in depth conversation with my four year old about this!

It's a wonderful story and the rhymes, as you'd expect from Dr. Seuss, just keep on coming. The descriptive terms are so evocative, from the 'comfortable sound' of the humming fish to the Once-Ler's teeth 'sounding grey'. It's also heartbreaking and of course, even more relevant now than it was back then. I choked up when I read the last line. The heart-wrenching thing is that the lessons of a story first written in 1971 have been pretty much ignored. 
 I'm not going to watch the film though, it looks horrible."

In the book the pirate looked into Jack's book bag to look for gold and there was nothing in it. So the pirate took Jack and Annie because he thought they were hiding gold from him. What I liked about this book is when the two kids, Annie and Jack, try to escape from the bad guy's ship. They saved themselves instead of being rescued. 
 I thought the librarian at the end of the book was cool and looked very pretty, like princess. She has a special crown on top of her head that takes her to her magical library and she wears a long pretty dress. In the end the pirate opened the treasure box right away and he was surprised and got mad. Then Annie and Jack took him to the wrong treasure chest, by accident. The only thing in the treasure chest was plain old dust.

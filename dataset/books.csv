The hall was large and low, the roof arched, and supported on thick short columns, almost like the crypt of a Cathedral; the walls were thick, and the windows, which had no glass, were very small, set in such a depth of wall that there was a wide deep window seat, upon which the rain might beat, without reaching the interior of the room. And even if it had come in, there was nothing for it to hurt, for the walls were of rough stone, and the floor of tiles. There was a fire at each end of this great dark apartment, but there were no chimneys over the ample hearths, and the smoke curled about in thick white folds in the vaulted roof, adding to the wreaths of soot, which made the hall look still darker.","[{'author_id': '176982', 'role': ''}]",2006.0,1017394,196,1003518,The Little Duke,The Little Duke,1406955302,9781406955309,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

Inspired by a centuries-old legend of tea-picking monkeys, here is a richly told tale full of vivid characters: the heartless Overseer, the enigmatic Royal Tea Taster, and -- far away -- an empress with a penchant for tea.","[{'author_id': '200052', 'role': ''}, {'author_id': '2076', 'role': 'Illustrator'}, {'author_id': '66828', 'role': ''}]",,7559662,48,7350637,Cloud Tea Monkeys,Cloud Tea Monkeys,0763644536,9780763644536,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320536074m/7559662.jpg

""Poor George had two teeth in his mouth
The day the votes came in.
The people had a President,
But one afraid to grin.""
From battling toothaches while fighting the British, to having rotten teeth removed by his dentists, the Father of His Country suffered all his life with tooth problems. Yet, contrary to popular belief, he never had a set of wooden teeth. Starting at the age of twenty-four, George Washington lost on average a tooth a year, and by the time he was elected President, he had only two left! In this reverentially funny tale written in verse and based on Washington's letters, diaries, and other historical records, readers will find out what really happened as they follow the trail of lost teeth to complete tooflessness.
Illustrated in watercolors with subtle humor by Brock Cole, the main story is followed by a four-page time line featuring reproduced period portraits of Washington.

eng,5,4.2,"In her autobiography, The Story of My Life (1952), Enid Blyton says that, from an early age, she ""liked making up stories better than I liked doing anything else."" As a child she would go to bed at night and stories would flood into her mind ""all mixed-up, rather like dreams are, but yet each story had its own definite thread--its beginning and middle and ending."" Enid Blyton did not realise at the time that that was unusual, remarking in a letter to psychologist Peter McKellar on 15th February 1953: ""I thought all children had the same 'night stories' and was amazed when one day I found they hadn't."" She described her ""night stories"" as ""all kinds of imaginings in story form,"" saying: ""Because of this imagining I wanted to write--to put down what I had seen and felt and heard in my imagination.""
The young Enid was keen to develop her writing and story-telling skills. She told stories to her brothers, made up her own rhymes based on the rhythm and rhyme-scheme of popular nursery-rhymes, kept a diary, wrote letters to real and imaginary recipients, entered literary competitions and paid great attention in English lessons at school. She also read widely. As well as fiction and poetry, she read biographies of famous authors and borrowed books from the library on the Art of Writing.
The advice Enid Blyton gives in The Story of My Life to children who want to write is: ""Fill your mind with all kinds of interesting things--the more you have in it, the more will come out of it. Nothing ever comes out of your mind that hasn't already been put into it in some form or other. It may come out changed, re-arranged, polished, shining, almost unrecognizable--but nevertheless it was you who put it there first of all. Your thoughts, your actions, your reading, your sense of humour, everything gets packed into your mind, and if you have an imagination, what a wonderful assortment it will have to choose from!""
Enid began submitting her work to publishers when she was in her teens, but at that stage she received countless rejection slips. However, that only made her all the more determined to persevere with her writing: ""It is partly the struggle that helps you so much, that gives you determination, character, self-reliance--all things that help in any profession or trade, and most certainly in writing."" As we know, Enid Blyton went on to achieve phenomenal success, beginning with the publication of magazine articles and poetry when she was in her twenties.","[{'author_id': '10657', 'role': ''}]",,3153502,10,3185083,The Story Of My Life,The Story Of My Life,0246127953,9780246127952,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1312043598m/3153502.jpg

Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.""
Dr. Seuss's small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest, scowling holiday grumps of all time. For 53 years, the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain, looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His ""wonderful, awful"" idea is to don a Santa outfit, strap heavy antlers on his poor, quivering dog Max, construct a makeshift sleigh, head down to Whoville, and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all.
Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up, the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos' presents, their food, even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle sleigh to Mt. Crumpit to dump it and waits to hear the sobs of the Whos when they wake up and discover the trappings of Christmas have disappeared. Imagine the Whos' dismay when they discover the evil-doings of Grinch in his anti-Santa guise. But what is that sound? It's not sobbing, but singing! Children simultaneously adore and fear this triumphant, twisted Seussian testimonial to the undaunted cheerfulness of the Whos, the transcendent nature of joy, and of course, the growth potential of a heart that's two sizes too small.

Author bio:
A world traveler and avid cyclist, Peter Liptak loves to say ""WOO HOO!"" and knows that the simple experiences in life hold the greatest adventures. He explored many interests at the University of Minnesota, from the wonders of Astronomy and Anthropology to philosophy and poetics, before graduating with BA in English Literature and History. Peter learned new skills as a preschool teacher, waiter, dance instructor and massage therapist while in school, and has worked as an actor, teacher, and writer since. Living in Korea, he studied Korean History, receiving his Master's from Yonsei University in Seoul and helps Korean children visit summer camp in the US to explore a new culture for themselves.
Discovering the beauty of each moment and always open to new possibilities, he began his bicycle adventures early, often venturing out with his sister on rickety yellow bikes meant for adults. Such memories inspired him to venture ever further, journeying through Europe and across Asia, finding adventure on two wheels and even testing his mettle in Ironman triathlons and desert races.

Twelve-year-old Molly Mahoney is in the middle of everything. She's in the middle of her parent's impending divorce. She's in the middle of her rebellious older sister and her lazy younger sister. She's in the middle of her class, ranked at exactly 143 out of 286. Even her name (first and last!) places her right in the middle of the alphabet. And after a morning where her parents forget to drive her to school, and the field trip she was supposed to be on leaves without her, Molly decides it's time to figure out how she can finally be in the spotlight--and stop being invisible.
But her new, outlandish ways put her in a different middle altogether. She now finds herself in the middle of her new, popular group of friends, who think the New Molly is amazing and bold, while her old BFF, Kellan thinks the New Molly is mean and aloof and headed for trouble. What's worse, Kellan doesn't hide his feelings. Faced with a probable future in a wheelchair, Kellan doesn't understand why Molly would risk getting in trouble just to be popular. So when Molly has to choose between going to the year's biggest party with her new pals, or participating in the Muscular Dystrophy Walk with Kellan, she's stuck in the middle once again. Can Molly reconcile the Old Molly with New Molly--and figure out the best way to make her mark?","[{'author_id': '8152047', 'role': ''}]",2017.0,27508575,10,47548092,Molly in the Middle,Molly in the Middle,,,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1493695435m/27508575.jpg

While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing ""The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new."" There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be ""curiouser and curiouser,"" seemingly without moral or sense.
For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully non-moralistic, non-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the ""regular course"" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.","[{'author_id': '8164', 'role': ''}, {'author_id': '180439', 'role': 'Illustrator'}]",2008.0,2647293,4559,55548884,"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, #1)","Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, #1)",1904808166,9781904808169,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1389443668m/2647293.jpg

Rendered in pop-up form, the tree begins as a small seedling, barely noticeable amid the snow, and grows a little with each turn of the page. Soon it is a tall specimen in full leaf, changing color with the seasons. Years go by, and then it is gone. Somewhere a new seedling begins to grow. When something we expect always to be there disappears, we realize the significance of its presence. But even as it expresses this sense of loss, the book ends on a note that resonates with hope.
The minimalist design by an internationally known artist draws readers in with its quiet power. Author Katsumi Komagata appeals to the senses in poetically spare language and with careful attention to every detail: the changing shape of the growing tree, its color, the shading of the background, even the weight and texture of the paper--such slight nuances shape our perceptions.

The book itself has little to no plot. Instead, the narrator asks various animals what they see with the response usually being another animal, the respondent is then asked what they themselves see, and the process is repeated. It features a Brown Bear, Red Bird, Yellow Duck, Blue Horse, Green Frog, Purple Cat, White Dog, Black Sheep, a Goldfish, a Teacher or a Mother, and Students or Children. The 1984 British edition of the book substitutes a monkey for the teacher.

eng,18,4.43,"One summer afternoon in 1862, the Rev. Charles Lutwidge Dodgson took a rowboat out on the Thames. With him were three young friends from the Liddell family--the sisters Lorina, Edith, and Alice. Dodgson often spun fairy tales on these boating trips to pass the time, and on this particular afternoon the story was particularly well received by Alice, who afterwards entreated him to write it down for her. Dodgson recalled the pivotal moment thusly: ""In a desperate attempt to strike out some new line of fairy-lore, I had sent my heroine straight down a rabbit-hole, to begin with, without the least idea what was to happen afterwards.""
The tale, initially titled Alice's Adventures Under Ground, became Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, which Dodgson published in 1865 as Lewis Carroll. So began the journey, now in its 150th year, of one of the most beloved stories of all time.
The Annotated Alice: 150th Anniversary Deluxe Editioncompiles over half a century of scholarship by leading Carrollian experts to reveal the history and full depth of the Alice books and their enigmatic creator. This volume brings together Martin Gardner's legendary original 1960 publication, The Annotated Alice; his follow-ups, More Annotated Aliceand the Definitive Edition; his continuing explication through the Knight Lettermagazine; and masterly additions and updates edited by Mark Burstein, president emeritus of the Lewis Carroll Society of North America. In these pages Lewis Carroll's mathematical riddles and curious wordplay, ingeniously embedded throughout the Alice works, are delightfully decoded and presented in the margins, along with original correspondence, amusing anecdotal detours, and fanciful illustrations by Salvador Dali, Beatrix Potter, Ralph Steadman, and a host of other famous artists.
Put simply, this anniversary edition of The Annotated Aliceis the most comprehensive collection of Alice materials ever published in a single volume. May it serve as a beautiful and enduring tribute to the charming, utterly original ""new line of fairy-lore"" that Lewis Carroll first spun 150 years ago.

A rare, never-before-published portrait of Francis Jane Lutwidge, Lewis Carroll's mother
Over 100 new or updated annotations, collected since the publication of Martin Gardner's Definitive Editionof The Annotated Alicein 1999

Simon, Jane and Barney Drew are once more on holiday in Trewissick in Cornwall with their Great-Uncle Merry. Jane is allowed to witness an old local ritual, in which the women of the village create a giant figure woven of hawthorn branches as an offering for the sea goddess. This figure - the Greenwitch - is both eerie and menacing, yet Jane also senses its melancholy loneliness. She makes a wish that it might be happy - a wish that will have a fateful effect on the battle between the Old Ones and the Dark.

eng,12,3.98,"Dazai Osamu wrote The Fairy Tale Book (Otogizoshi) in the last months of the Pacific War. The traditional tales upon which Dazai's retellings are based are well known to every Japanese schoolchild, but this is no children's book. In Dazai's hands such stock characters as the kindhearted Oji-san to Oba-san (""Grandmother and Grandfather""), the mischievous tanuki badger, the fearsome Oni ogres, the greedy old man, the ""tongue-cut"" sparrow, and of course Urashima Taro (the Japanese Rip van Winkle) become complex individuals facing difficult and nuanced moral dilemmas. The resulting stories are thought-provoking, slyly subversive, and often hilarious.
In spite of the ""gloom and doom"" atmosphere always cited in reviews of The Setting Sun and the later No Longer Human, though, Dazai's cutting wit and rich humor are evident in the entire body of his work. His literature depicts the human condition in painfully blunt and realistic terms, but, like life itself, is often accompanied by a smile.","[{'author_id': '113561', 'role': ''}, {'author_id': '3917757', 'role': 'Introduction'}, {'author_id': '324549', 'role': 'Translator'}]",2011.0,12218696,135,17191908,Otogizōshi: The Fairy Tale Book of Dazai Osamu,Otogizōshi: The Fairy Tale Book of Dazai Osamu,4902075407,9784902075403,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

en-GB,25,3.99,"**WINNER OF THE BEST UNPUBLISHED NOVEL IN THE 2010 NEW YORK BOOK FESTIVAL**
Flea has always been different from other students in school. He's not smart or athletic, he's shorter than kids five years younger than him and his facial features are so pointy that everyone avoids him. His foster mother constantly warns him to avoid attention, though Flea has no idea who's after them. But Flea has recently discovered several abilities that change his life forever: snowy weather follows him wherever he goes, he stops snowballs in mid-flight and he builds anything in shop class in the matter of minutes despite his lack of training. An appearance on The Great Build-Off - a popular construction game show - leads him to a magical place he thought existed only in Christmas stories.
At the North Pole, Flea feels even more like an outsider. In fact, this storybook village reminds him of every school he'd ever attended, complete with overachievers and underachievers, popular elves and outcasts, even elves who aren't afraid to march to their own beat. But during his training to become a proper builder elf, he discovers that the North Pole has an arch-nemesis bent on invading the elfish lands and ending Christmas forever. With a war looming against the South Pole, Flea's sudden appearance at the North Pole is no coincidence, as he questions his role in the fate of the world's greatest holiday.
""The North Pole Challenge"" is not your typical Christmas story. Everyone knows about Santa Claus, his elves and the North Pole but this book provides a fresh outlook on the old familiar tales. Imagine Santa Claus as a reclusive loner, Rudolph as a narcissistic whiner, the elves as cruel party animals. And no great story would be complete without an enemy of epic proportions, another familiar Christmas name with a wicked past never before told...

Reviews:
""Inspired by The House That Jack Built, Becker and Parkins create a delightful story of Halloween fun. Each double page spread features a new ghoul, with the exception of the ""fairy all forlorn"" who is bit by the ""count, on the prowl until morn"". The cute wit, combined with the comical illustrations, makes this a great read-aloud book. Both children and adults can enjoy the brightly coloured pages, the evenly paced rhymes, the spirited characters and the satisfying ending - complete with Verta Bray's Recipe for Halloween Skeleton Stew. A great addition to Halloween collections! Highly Recommended.""

""With a Halloween twist to the classic This is the House that Jack Built nursery rhyme, this book's cute illustrations make for a delightful read for younger trick-or-treaters. The repetition of lines as the story progresses will also boost word recognition and encourage reading -- but don't tell your kid that.""

""This wonderful Hallowe'en book for young children has a house that Jack built, a ghost, a ghoul, the mummy, the beast with the pointy horn, a fairy, a count, a skeleton, a witch, and a monster and a lot of Hallowe'en rhyming fun. The illustrations are incredible. With each page we are introduced to a new creature and the story expands. The rhyme becomes more complicated and extended as we meet the creatures and there is an unexpected twist at the end. This book will be great fun for children of all ages.""

""Jake's Review: Cool its by Helaine Becker, I like her books. It is a fun story with lots of really funny pictures. It is easy to read and I think it would be a better story for younger boys like my midget brother. The guy who did the pictures has a great imagination and the pictures are fun not scary....I really liked the little rhyme at the end of the book, it made me laugh.
Jake's Rating: 8.5/10
Mom's Review: O.K. I will admit it I am prejudiced on this one, I adore Helaine Becker and I LOVE Halloween, so you know it's probably going to get a good rating just based on those facts. But it really is a lovely book. The illustrations are absolutely adorable, and nice and bright and colourful...I loved the rhyme and the injection of a few big new words for the little ones to learn. This would be a great book to read to the little ones in the 3- 5 age at Halloween, and a great story for the 5 1/2 - 8 yr old to read by themselves. A great addition to any [library!]

When Mr. Hollister's sport and toy store, The Trading Post, is robbed, his main concern is for his invention, a new type of collapsible canoe. He is therefore surprised to discover that a Geiger counter and a couple of pickaxes are the only missing items.
After putting the problem of the theft in the hands of the police, the family turns to the matter of testing the canoe. An interested buyer who owns a forest tract has offered his property to the Hollisters for this purpose. They plan to camp out in the forest and test the canoe on the lake and rapids within the boundaries of the property.
All goes well until they come across a ""talking"" scarecrow blocking the road to their campsite and warning them to turn back because danger awaits them in the forest. The Hollisters refuse to take the warning seriously and continue to set up their camp.
From this point on the strange and unusual events that beset them in the forest seem mysteriously connected with the theft at the store and a search for uranium.
Another exciting adventure that will be welcomed by the hundreds of thousands of Happy Hollister fans.

Elidor was a priest who as a boy was led by dwarves to a castle of gold in a land that, while beautiful, was not illuminated by the full light of the sun.[1] This compares with Garner's description of the golden walls of Gorias contrasting with the dull sky of the land of Elidor.","[{'author_id': '47991', 'role': ''}]",1967.0,13615935,18,2987303,Elidor,Elidor,,,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1335309538m/13615935.jpg

Arthur Geisert's ingenuity engages the child's imagination as well as the adult's through seamless storytelling and zany wit. Invested as always in his porcine universe, here Geisert tells the story of a community of pigs that is suffering from the heat. Rather than be sapped of energy and miserable, they go on an adventure in search of ice. The pigs' inventiveness and great can-do spirit create a joyful tale of change and adventure. The illustrations bring the action to life, making this a real page-turner and a great read-aloud book!
Arthur Geisert's pigs are legendary in the world of children's books. They carve ice sculptures, teach Roman numerals, create ingenious machines and get up to all kinds of antics. Did Arthur grow up on a farm? No. He grew up in Los Angeles and claims not to have seen a pig until he was an adult. Trained as a sculptor in college, Geisert learned to etch at the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles. Geisert has published just about a book a year for the past thirty years, and every one of his books has been illustrated with etchings. His work has appeared in The New Yorkerand the Horn Book Magazine, and he has won The New York Times' Best Illustrated Award. A resident of Galena, a community in northwest Illinois, for decades, he now lives in a converted bank building in Bernard, Iowa.","[{'author_id': '200377', 'role': ''}]",2011.0,10292225,275,15194076,Ice,Ice,1592700985,9781592700981,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327974097m/10292225.jpg

Once, Indians also lived on the island. And when they left and sailed to the east, one young girl was left behind.
This is the story of Karana, the Indian girl who lived alone for years on the Island of the Blue Dolphins. Year after year, she watched one season pass into another and waited for a ship to take her away. But while she waited, she kept herself alive by building a shelter, making weapons, finding food, and fighting her enemies, the wild dogs. It is not only an unusual adventure of survival, but also a tale of natural beauty and personal discovery.

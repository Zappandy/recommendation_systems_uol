The hall was large and low, the roof arched, and supported on thick short columns, almost like the crypt of a Cathedral; the walls were thick, and the windows, which had no glass, were very small, set in such a depth of wall that there was a wide deep window seat, upon which the rain might beat, without reaching the interior of the room. And even if it had come in, there was nothing for it to hurt, for the walls were of rough stone, and the floor of tiles. There was a fire at each end of this great dark apartment, but there were no chimneys over the ample hearths, and the smoke curled about in thick white folds in the vaulted roof, adding to the wreaths of soot, which made the hall look still darker.","[{'author_id': '176982', 'role': ''}]",2006.0,1017394,196,1003518,The Little Duke,The Little Duke,1406955302,9781406955309,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

Inspired by a centuries-old legend of tea-picking monkeys, here is a richly told tale full of vivid characters: the heartless Overseer, the enigmatic Royal Tea Taster, and -- far away -- an empress with a penchant for tea.","[{'author_id': '200052', 'role': ''}, {'author_id': '2076', 'role': 'Illustrator'}, {'author_id': '66828', 'role': ''}]",,7559662,48,7350637,Cloud Tea Monkeys,Cloud Tea Monkeys,0763644536,9780763644536,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320536074m/7559662.jpg

""Poor George had two teeth in his mouth
The day the votes came in.
The people had a President,
But one afraid to grin.""
From battling toothaches while fighting the British, to having rotten teeth removed by his dentists, the Father of His Country suffered all his life with tooth problems. Yet, contrary to popular belief, he never had a set of wooden teeth. Starting at the age of twenty-four, George Washington lost on average a tooth a year, and by the time he was elected President, he had only two left! In this reverentially funny tale written in verse and based on Washington's letters, diaries, and other historical records, readers will find out what really happened as they follow the trail of lost teeth to complete tooflessness.
Illustrated in watercolors with subtle humor by Brock Cole, the main story is followed by a four-page time line featuring reproduced period portraits of Washington.

eng,5,4.2,"In her autobiography, The Story of My Life (1952), Enid Blyton says that, from an early age, she ""liked making up stories better than I liked doing anything else."" As a child she would go to bed at night and stories would flood into her mind ""all mixed-up, rather like dreams are, but yet each story had its own definite thread--its beginning and middle and ending."" Enid Blyton did not realise at the time that that was unusual, remarking in a letter to psychologist Peter McKellar on 15th February 1953: ""I thought all children had the same 'night stories' and was amazed when one day I found they hadn't."" She described her ""night stories"" as ""all kinds of imaginings in story form,"" saying: ""Because of this imagining I wanted to write--to put down what I had seen and felt and heard in my imagination.""
The young Enid was keen to develop her writing and story-telling skills. She told stories to her brothers, made up her own rhymes based on the rhythm and rhyme-scheme of popular nursery-rhymes, kept a diary, wrote letters to real and imaginary recipients, entered literary competitions and paid great attention in English lessons at school. She also read widely. As well as fiction and poetry, she read biographies of famous authors and borrowed books from the library on the Art of Writing.
The advice Enid Blyton gives in The Story of My Life to children who want to write is: ""Fill your mind with all kinds of interesting things--the more you have in it, the more will come out of it. Nothing ever comes out of your mind that hasn't already been put into it in some form or other. It may come out changed, re-arranged, polished, shining, almost unrecognizable--but nevertheless it was you who put it there first of all. Your thoughts, your actions, your reading, your sense of humour, everything gets packed into your mind, and if you have an imagination, what a wonderful assortment it will have to choose from!""
Enid began submitting her work to publishers when she was in her teens, but at that stage she received countless rejection slips. However, that only made her all the more determined to persevere with her writing: ""It is partly the struggle that helps you so much, that gives you determination, character, self-reliance--all things that help in any profession or trade, and most certainly in writing."" As we know, Enid Blyton went on to achieve phenomenal success, beginning with the publication of magazine articles and poetry when she was in her twenties.","[{'author_id': '10657', 'role': ''}]",,3153502,10,3185083,The Story Of My Life,The Story Of My Life,0246127953,9780246127952,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1312043598m/3153502.jpg

Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.""
Dr. Seuss's small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest, scowling holiday grumps of all time. For 53 years, the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain, looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His ""wonderful, awful"" idea is to don a Santa outfit, strap heavy antlers on his poor, quivering dog Max, construct a makeshift sleigh, head down to Whoville, and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all.
Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up, the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos' presents, their food, even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle sleigh to Mt. Crumpit to dump it and waits to hear the sobs of the Whos when they wake up and discover the trappings of Christmas have disappeared. Imagine the Whos' dismay when they discover the evil-doings of Grinch in his anti-Santa guise. But what is that sound? It's not sobbing, but singing! Children simultaneously adore and fear this triumphant, twisted Seussian testimonial to the undaunted cheerfulness of the Whos, the transcendent nature of joy, and of course, the growth potential of a heart that's two sizes too small.

Author bio:
A world traveler and avid cyclist, Peter Liptak loves to say ""WOO HOO!"" and knows that the simple experiences in life hold the greatest adventures. He explored many interests at the University of Minnesota, from the wonders of Astronomy and Anthropology to philosophy and poetics, before graduating with BA in English Literature and History. Peter learned new skills as a preschool teacher, waiter, dance instructor and massage therapist while in school, and has worked as an actor, teacher, and writer since. Living in Korea, he studied Korean History, receiving his Master's from Yonsei University in Seoul and helps Korean children visit summer camp in the US to explore a new culture for themselves.
Discovering the beauty of each moment and always open to new possibilities, he began his bicycle adventures early, often venturing out with his sister on rickety yellow bikes meant for adults. Such memories inspired him to venture ever further, journeying through Europe and across Asia, finding adventure on two wheels and even testing his mettle in Ironman triathlons and desert races.

Twelve-year-old Molly Mahoney is in the middle of everything. She's in the middle of her parent's impending divorce. She's in the middle of her rebellious older sister and her lazy younger sister. She's in the middle of her class, ranked at exactly 143 out of 286. Even her name (first and last!) places her right in the middle of the alphabet. And after a morning where her parents forget to drive her to school, and the field trip she was supposed to be on leaves without her, Molly decides it's time to figure out how she can finally be in the spotlight--and stop being invisible.
But her new, outlandish ways put her in a different middle altogether. She now finds herself in the middle of her new, popular group of friends, who think the New Molly is amazing and bold, while her old BFF, Kellan thinks the New Molly is mean and aloof and headed for trouble. What's worse, Kellan doesn't hide his feelings. Faced with a probable future in a wheelchair, Kellan doesn't understand why Molly would risk getting in trouble just to be popular. So when Molly has to choose between going to the year's biggest party with her new pals, or participating in the Muscular Dystrophy Walk with Kellan, she's stuck in the middle once again. Can Molly reconcile the Old Molly with New Molly--and figure out the best way to make her mark?","[{'author_id': '8152047', 'role': ''}]",2017.0,27508575,10,47548092,Molly in the Middle,Molly in the Middle,,,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1493695435m/27508575.jpg

While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing ""The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new."" There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be ""curiouser and curiouser,"" seemingly without moral or sense.
For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully non-moralistic, non-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the ""regular course"" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.","[{'author_id': '8164', 'role': ''}, {'author_id': '180439', 'role': 'Illustrator'}]",2008.0,2647293,4559,55548884,"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, #1)","Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, #1)",1904808166,9781904808169,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1389443668m/2647293.jpg

Rendered in pop-up form, the tree begins as a small seedling, barely noticeable amid the snow, and grows a little with each turn of the page. Soon it is a tall specimen in full leaf, changing color with the seasons. Years go by, and then it is gone. Somewhere a new seedling begins to grow. When something we expect always to be there disappears, we realize the significance of its presence. But even as it expresses this sense of loss, the book ends on a note that resonates with hope.
The minimalist design by an internationally known artist draws readers in with its quiet power. Author Katsumi Komagata appeals to the senses in poetically spare language and with careful attention to every detail: the changing shape of the growing tree, its color, the shading of the background, even the weight and texture of the paper--such slight nuances shape our perceptions.

The book itself has little to no plot. Instead, the narrator asks various animals what they see with the response usually being another animal, the respondent is then asked what they themselves see, and the process is repeated. It features a Brown Bear, Red Bird, Yellow Duck, Blue Horse, Green Frog, Purple Cat, White Dog, Black Sheep, a Goldfish, a Teacher or a Mother, and Students or Children. The 1984 British edition of the book substitutes a monkey for the teacher.

eng,18,4.43,"One summer afternoon in 1862, the Rev. Charles Lutwidge Dodgson took a rowboat out on the Thames. With him were three young friends from the Liddell family--the sisters Lorina, Edith, and Alice. Dodgson often spun fairy tales on these boating trips to pass the time, and on this particular afternoon the story was particularly well received by Alice, who afterwards entreated him to write it down for her. Dodgson recalled the pivotal moment thusly: ""In a desperate attempt to strike out some new line of fairy-lore, I had sent my heroine straight down a rabbit-hole, to begin with, without the least idea what was to happen afterwards.""
The tale, initially titled Alice's Adventures Under Ground, became Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, which Dodgson published in 1865 as Lewis Carroll. So began the journey, now in its 150th year, of one of the most beloved stories of all time.
The Annotated Alice: 150th Anniversary Deluxe Editioncompiles over half a century of scholarship by leading Carrollian experts to reveal the history and full depth of the Alice books and their enigmatic creator. This volume brings together Martin Gardner's legendary original 1960 publication, The Annotated Alice; his follow-ups, More Annotated Aliceand the Definitive Edition; his continuing explication through the Knight Lettermagazine; and masterly additions and updates edited by Mark Burstein, president emeritus of the Lewis Carroll Society of North America. In these pages Lewis Carroll's mathematical riddles and curious wordplay, ingeniously embedded throughout the Alice works, are delightfully decoded and presented in the margins, along with original correspondence, amusing anecdotal detours, and fanciful illustrations by Salvador Dali, Beatrix Potter, Ralph Steadman, and a host of other famous artists.
Put simply, this anniversary edition of The Annotated Aliceis the most comprehensive collection of Alice materials ever published in a single volume. May it serve as a beautiful and enduring tribute to the charming, utterly original ""new line of fairy-lore"" that Lewis Carroll first spun 150 years ago.

A rare, never-before-published portrait of Francis Jane Lutwidge, Lewis Carroll's mother
Over 100 new or updated annotations, collected since the publication of Martin Gardner's Definitive Editionof The Annotated Alicein 1999

Simon, Jane and Barney Drew are once more on holiday in Trewissick in Cornwall with their Great-Uncle Merry. Jane is allowed to witness an old local ritual, in which the women of the village create a giant figure woven of hawthorn branches as an offering for the sea goddess. This figure - the Greenwitch - is both eerie and menacing, yet Jane also senses its melancholy loneliness. She makes a wish that it might be happy - a wish that will have a fateful effect on the battle between the Old Ones and the Dark.

eng,12,3.98,"Dazai Osamu wrote The Fairy Tale Book (Otogizoshi) in the last months of the Pacific War. The traditional tales upon which Dazai's retellings are based are well known to every Japanese schoolchild, but this is no children's book. In Dazai's hands such stock characters as the kindhearted Oji-san to Oba-san (""Grandmother and Grandfather""), the mischievous tanuki badger, the fearsome Oni ogres, the greedy old man, the ""tongue-cut"" sparrow, and of course Urashima Taro (the Japanese Rip van Winkle) become complex individuals facing difficult and nuanced moral dilemmas. The resulting stories are thought-provoking, slyly subversive, and often hilarious.
In spite of the ""gloom and doom"" atmosphere always cited in reviews of The Setting Sun and the later No Longer Human, though, Dazai's cutting wit and rich humor are evident in the entire body of his work. His literature depicts the human condition in painfully blunt and realistic terms, but, like life itself, is often accompanied by a smile.","[{'author_id': '113561', 'role': ''}, {'author_id': '3917757', 'role': 'Introduction'}, {'author_id': '324549', 'role': 'Translator'}]",2011.0,12218696,135,17191908,Otogizōshi: The Fairy Tale Book of Dazai Osamu,Otogizōshi: The Fairy Tale Book of Dazai Osamu,4902075407,9784902075403,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

en-GB,25,3.99,"**WINNER OF THE BEST UNPUBLISHED NOVEL IN THE 2010 NEW YORK BOOK FESTIVAL**
Flea has always been different from other students in school. He's not smart or athletic, he's shorter than kids five years younger than him and his facial features are so pointy that everyone avoids him. His foster mother constantly warns him to avoid attention, though Flea has no idea who's after them. But Flea has recently discovered several abilities that change his life forever: snowy weather follows him wherever he goes, he stops snowballs in mid-flight and he builds anything in shop class in the matter of minutes despite his lack of training. An appearance on The Great Build-Off - a popular construction game show - leads him to a magical place he thought existed only in Christmas stories.
At the North Pole, Flea feels even more like an outsider. In fact, this storybook village reminds him of every school he'd ever attended, complete with overachievers and underachievers, popular elves and outcasts, even elves who aren't afraid to march to their own beat. But during his training to become a proper builder elf, he discovers that the North Pole has an arch-nemesis bent on invading the elfish lands and ending Christmas forever. With a war looming against the South Pole, Flea's sudden appearance at the North Pole is no coincidence, as he questions his role in the fate of the world's greatest holiday.
""The North Pole Challenge"" is not your typical Christmas story. Everyone knows about Santa Claus, his elves and the North Pole but this book provides a fresh outlook on the old familiar tales. Imagine Santa Claus as a reclusive loner, Rudolph as a narcissistic whiner, the elves as cruel party animals. And no great story would be complete without an enemy of epic proportions, another familiar Christmas name with a wicked past never before told...

Reviews:
""Inspired by The House That Jack Built, Becker and Parkins create a delightful story of Halloween fun. Each double page spread features a new ghoul, with the exception of the ""fairy all forlorn"" who is bit by the ""count, on the prowl until morn"". The cute wit, combined with the comical illustrations, makes this a great read-aloud book. Both children and adults can enjoy the brightly coloured pages, the evenly paced rhymes, the spirited characters and the satisfying ending - complete with Verta Bray's Recipe for Halloween Skeleton Stew. A great addition to Halloween collections! Highly Recommended.""

""With a Halloween twist to the classic This is the House that Jack Built nursery rhyme, this book's cute illustrations make for a delightful read for younger trick-or-treaters. The repetition of lines as the story progresses will also boost word recognition and encourage reading -- but don't tell your kid that.""

""This wonderful Hallowe'en book for young children has a house that Jack built, a ghost, a ghoul, the mummy, the beast with the pointy horn, a fairy, a count, a skeleton, a witch, and a monster and a lot of Hallowe'en rhyming fun. The illustrations are incredible. With each page we are introduced to a new creature and the story expands. The rhyme becomes more complicated and extended as we meet the creatures and there is an unexpected twist at the end. This book will be great fun for children of all ages.""

""Jake's Review: Cool its by Helaine Becker, I like her books. It is a fun story with lots of really funny pictures. It is easy to read and I think it would be a better story for younger boys like my midget brother. The guy who did the pictures has a great imagination and the pictures are fun not scary....I really liked the little rhyme at the end of the book, it made me laugh.
Jake's Rating: 8.5/10
Mom's Review: O.K. I will admit it I am prejudiced on this one, I adore Helaine Becker and I LOVE Halloween, so you know it's probably going to get a good rating just based on those facts. But it really is a lovely book. The illustrations are absolutely adorable, and nice and bright and colourful...I loved the rhyme and the injection of a few big new words for the little ones to learn. This would be a great book to read to the little ones in the 3- 5 age at Halloween, and a great story for the 5 1/2 - 8 yr old to read by themselves. A great addition to any [library!]

When Mr. Hollister's sport and toy store, The Trading Post, is robbed, his main concern is for his invention, a new type of collapsible canoe. He is therefore surprised to discover that a Geiger counter and a couple of pickaxes are the only missing items.
After putting the problem of the theft in the hands of the police, the family turns to the matter of testing the canoe. An interested buyer who owns a forest tract has offered his property to the Hollisters for this purpose. They plan to camp out in the forest and test the canoe on the lake and rapids within the boundaries of the property.
All goes well until they come across a ""talking"" scarecrow blocking the road to their campsite and warning them to turn back because danger awaits them in the forest. The Hollisters refuse to take the warning seriously and continue to set up their camp.
From this point on the strange and unusual events that beset them in the forest seem mysteriously connected with the theft at the store and a search for uranium.
Another exciting adventure that will be welcomed by the hundreds of thousands of Happy Hollister fans.

Elidor was a priest who as a boy was led by dwarves to a castle of gold in a land that, while beautiful, was not illuminated by the full light of the sun.[1] This compares with Garner's description of the golden walls of Gorias contrasting with the dull sky of the land of Elidor.","[{'author_id': '47991', 'role': ''}]",1967.0,13615935,18,2987303,Elidor,Elidor,,,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1335309538m/13615935.jpg

Arthur Geisert's ingenuity engages the child's imagination as well as the adult's through seamless storytelling and zany wit. Invested as always in his porcine universe, here Geisert tells the story of a community of pigs that is suffering from the heat. Rather than be sapped of energy and miserable, they go on an adventure in search of ice. The pigs' inventiveness and great can-do spirit create a joyful tale of change and adventure. The illustrations bring the action to life, making this a real page-turner and a great read-aloud book!
Arthur Geisert's pigs are legendary in the world of children's books. They carve ice sculptures, teach Roman numerals, create ingenious machines and get up to all kinds of antics. Did Arthur grow up on a farm? No. He grew up in Los Angeles and claims not to have seen a pig until he was an adult. Trained as a sculptor in college, Geisert learned to etch at the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles. Geisert has published just about a book a year for the past thirty years, and every one of his books has been illustrated with etchings. His work has appeared in The New Yorkerand the Horn Book Magazine, and he has won The New York Times' Best Illustrated Award. A resident of Galena, a community in northwest Illinois, for decades, he now lives in a converted bank building in Bernard, Iowa.","[{'author_id': '200377', 'role': ''}]",2011.0,10292225,275,15194076,Ice,Ice,1592700985,9781592700981,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327974097m/10292225.jpg

Once, Indians also lived on the island. And when they left and sailed to the east, one young girl was left behind.
This is the story of Karana, the Indian girl who lived alone for years on the Island of the Blue Dolphins.

But while she waited, she kept herself alive by building a shelter, making weapons, finding food, and fighting her enemies, the wild dogs.

en-US,4,4.59,"Christmas Day, 1914
My dear sister Janet,
It is 2:00 in the morning and most of our men are asleep in their dugouts -- yet I could not sleep myself before writing to you of the wonderful events of Christmas Eve. In truth, what happened seems almost like a fairy tale, and if I hadn't been through it myself, I would scarce believe it. Just imagine: While you and the family sang carols before the fire there in London, I did the same with enemy soldiers here on the battlefields of France!
The Christmas Truce of 1914 is one of the most extraordinary incidents not only of World War I but of all military history. Providing inspiration for songs, books, plays, and movies, it has endured as an archetypal image of peace. Yet much about the historic event remains shrouded in myth and legend.
In this fictional letter -- illustrated in authentic detail by Wendy Edelson -- award-winning author Aaron Shepard draws from firsthand accounts of soldiers at the front to portray the truce in its true nature and spirit.

3) Since they escaped from the Netherworld, he and his best friends have been sleeping like babies.
But Charlie can't shake the feeling that something strange is afoot. Charlotte's herbarium used to be one of the busiest stores in Cypress Creek. Now her loyal following is heading to Orville Falls for their herbal potions.
Weirder, though, Orville Falls is suddenly filled with . . . zombies? At least, they sure looklike the walking dead. Rumor has it that no one's sleeping in Orville Falls. And Charlie knows what that means.
Things are getting freaky again.

eng,9,3.94,"""If they had seen what we see, they would have judged as we judge."" -- Galileo Galilei
In every age there are courageous people who break with tradition to explore new ideas and challenge accepted truths. Galileo Galilei was just such a man--a genius--and the first to turn the telescope to the skies to map the heavens. In doing so, he offered objective evidence that the earth was not the fixed center of the universe but that it and all the other planets revolved around the sun. Galileo kept careful notes and made beautiful drawings of all that he observed. Through his telescope he brought the starts down to earth for everyone to see.
By changing the way people saw the galaxy, Galileo was also changing the way they saw themselves and their place in the universe. This was very exciting, but to some to some it was deeply disturbing. Galileo has upset the harmonious view of heaven and earth that had been accepted since ancient times. He had turned the world upside down.
In this amazing new book, Peter Sis employs the artist's lens to give us an extraordinary view of the life of Galileo Galilei. Sis tells his story in language as simple as a fairy tale, in pictures as rich and tightly woven as a tapestry, and in Galileo's own words, written more than 350 years ago and still resonant with truth. This title has Common Core connections.

The launch of an exciting and innovatively illustrated new series narrated by an unforgettable kid every family can relate to
It's a new school year, and Greg Heffley finds himself thrust into middle school, where undersized weaklings share the hallways with kids who are taller, meaner, and already shaving. The hazards of growing up before you're ready are uniquely revealed through words and drawings as Greg records them in his diary.
In book one of this debut series, Greg is happy to have Rowley, his sidekick, along for the ride. But when Rowley's star starts to rise, Greg tries to use his best friend's newfound popularity to his own advantage, kicking off a chain of events that will test their friendship in hilarious fashion.
Author/illustrator Jeff Kinney recalls the growing pains of school life and introduces a new kind of hero who epitomizes the challenges of being a kid. As Greg says in his diary, ""Just don't expect me to be all 'Dear Diary' this and 'Dear Diary' that."" Luckily for us, what Greg Heffley says he won't do and what he actually does are two very different things.

When 13-year-old Christopher runs away from an orphanage, he is kidnapped by undercover pirates who force him to pretend he is a relative who cannot speak, as they sign on to a merchant ship they are plotting to plunder. Trapped in silence, Christopher discovers he can talk with a highly skilled mouse who will teach him Five Life Lessons. The Captain's 12-year-old daughter Lucy discovers the truth about Christopher and befriends him. But can they stop the pirates? This thrilling tale piles on the fun, hidden treasure, swashbuckling swordfights, terrifying storms and island paradise adventures that make pirate sagas so enjoyable. What sets Arrgh! apart is its hero's heartwarming wish for family, and how he comes to find the family he will treasure forever.

Even more remarkably, her classmates love her even though she's a super-nerd and the teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in Matilda's world. For starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered parents who ever lived. Then there's the large, busty nightmare of a school principal, Mrs. (""The"") Trunchbull, a former hammer-throwing champion who flings children at will and is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer. Fortunately for Matilda, she has the inner resources to deal with such annoyances: astonishing intelligence, saintly patience, and an innate predilection for revenge.
She warms up with some practical jokes aimed at her hapless parents, but the true test comes when she rallies in defense of her teacher, the sweet Miss Honey, against the diabolical Trunchbull. There is never any doubt that Matilda will carry the day. Even so, this wonderful story is far from predictable--the big surprise comes when Matilda discovers a new, mysterious facet of her mental dexterity.

Within it are such gruesome details as a suspicious shopkeeper, unneccessary surgery, anesthesia, heart shaped balloons, and some very startling news about a fire.

eng,21,4.0,"Source of legend and lyric, reference and conjecture, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is for most children pure pleasure in prose. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing ""The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new."" There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be ""curiouser and curiouser,"" seemingly without moral or sense.
For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully non-moralistic, non-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the ""regular course"" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.","[{'author_id': '8164', 'role': ''}]",1920.0,11439031,288,55548884,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

It is ""...entertaining, educational & just plain fun"", a story of loss and discovery, a fable of growth and change, and love of the natural world.
Max is three and a half years old when his family moves to a new home, leaving behind his 'forest' -- a stand of trees in their old yard. His forest becomes the focus of his feelings of disruption and loss related to the move. The forest sends the swans with a message to alert the King of the Trees about the problem. The King holds a conference and many species of trees compete to live with Max. Finally, Grandfather Apple Tree resolves the question, and an apple tree is sent to be a companion to Max.
The main characters are unusual even in books for children--an elm tree, forest trees, apple trees, swans, and a Canaan dog--and early readers are enthusiastic. The book is in a new long form, 131 pages with 64 luminous color photographs, yet despite the unusual length, young readers devour the book in one sitting, eager to find out if Max does indeed get a tree. Parents and grandparents may choose to read the book with younger children over a few bedtime sessions.

Some are deceptive and even destructive.

Easy to use for the whole family, this beautiful hardcover volume is the first book in a four-part study that introduces young people, ages 6-14, to the basic truths of the Christian faith. Through engaging stories, creative notebooking, and fun activities, they will come to know and trust our loving God while building an unshakable faith to last a lifetime.

In my twenty-one years of working with youth and children's ministries, I have seen my share of resources and program materials. But rarely have I been as impressed as I am with Who Is God? (And Can I Really Know Him?). This is a vital resource, extremely well done, and one which I predict will become a standard text in many churches, homes, and schools. In our video-driven culture, many are saying that fewer and fewer people are reading and that it is especially hard to get kids into books. Yet my niece and nephew (both in elementary school) couldn't put this one down. I highly recommend this book and the entire What We Believe series.

In contrast, the illustrations here are wild and wonderful, and the accompanying language, while simple, is delightfully silly.

The first half was published in serial form between 1881 and 1883, and then completed as a book for children in February 1883. It is about the mischievous adventures of Pinocchio, an animated marionette, and his poor father, a woodcarver named Geppetto. It is considered a classic of children's literature and has spawned many derivative works of art, such as Disney's classic 1940 animated movie of the same name, and commonplace ideas, such as a liar's long nose.

In a quest that is both contemporary and timeless, Bill Richardsoncreates a magical world through inventive wordplay, uninhibited imagination and a facility with rhyme. Here is a raconteur who spins a narrative tale that takes readers into strange lands inhabited by unusual characters, both good and evil, where adventure abounds and unlikely saviors emerge.
Penelope is 101 years old, but she can remember the story like it happened yesterday. On the morning of her eleventh birthday, she wakes to discover she can no longer hear. It is on this same day that the Piper returns to Hamelin to spirit the children away in an evil act of revenge upon the townspeople. Spared because she is deaf to the Piper's bewitching tune, Penelope is left to grieve the loss of her friends and beloved sister Sophy until Cuthbert, the wise man of the village, reveals that Penelope possesses the unusual gift of deep dreaming.

I'm sorry to say that the book you are holding in your hands is extremely unpleasant. It tells an unhappy tale about three very unlucky children. Even though they are charming and clever, the Baudelaire siblings lead lives filled with misery and woe. From the very first page of this book when the children are at the beach and receive terrible news, continuing on through the entire story, disaster lurks at their heels. One might say they are magnets for misfortune.
In this short book alone, the three youngsters encounter a greedy and repulsive villain, itchy clothing, a disastrous fire, a plot to steal their fortune, and cold porridge for breakfast.
It is my sad duty to write down these unpleasant tales, but there is nothing stopping you from putting this book down at once and reading something happy, if you prefer that sort of thing.

Hugo is a little starfish. He finds his life dull. Tired of feeling sad, one day he sets off to find happiness. After much searching, he discovers something that makes his heart do a somersault! Sharing with others is the only thing that makes him truly happy.
Adults strive to teach children to share with their communities. Encouraging children to give teaches them empathy, as well as a sense of social responsibility. Children can feel empowered by giving and sharing with others.
This book is a great way to teach EMPATHY and the CALENDAR.
Meet HUGO - a little starfish with a BIG HEART. His passion is to make others happy but he still has a lot to learn. Luckily he does not only have a big heart but also a CURIOUS MIND.
Through his adventures, Hugo learns many valuable lessons of character, life skills, and ecological alertness - all amid the backdrop of a magical underwater world and mystical islands.
In Hugo, children, parents, and educators will discover a lovable and engaging role model with whom they can identify.
Suzy Liebermann has written this charming series of children's books to help educate children about their feelings, their attitude, their choices, and the consequences that follow.
Each book offers a themed vocabulary to introduce the Spanish language to the reader. Each book also comes with a number of worksheets which are downloadable at no cost on our website.
We are sure you'll agree that life skills and character traits are two of the most important lessons to teach the young. Age-appropriate children's books are crucial to child development and well-written books that contain a message can expand not only a child's cognitive abilities, but also their emotional, moral, and spiritual capacities.
The key theme behind the HUGO THE HAPPY STARFISH series is that building character based on a positive attitude leads to a happy, self-confident and successful human being.
We believe this distinctive way of sharing a ""message"" through the medium of an exciting narrative is what has given the books their charm.

Out of the way!"" As the tree grows bigger, people and animals traverse the path until it becomes a lane, flowing like a river around the tree -- getting out of its way. Over time, the lane becomes a road, and a young man crossing the road with his children remembers the baby tree from long ago. By the time he is an old man, the tree has become a giant. The city traffic continues to rattle past, noisier and busier than ever, but sometimes the great tree works its magic, and people just stop, and listen.
In this simple, lyrical story, a wide-spreading tree and a busy road grow simultaneously, even as time passes and the footsteps of people and animals give way to speeding cars, buses and trucks. The illustrations, in pen-and-ink with vibrant blocks of color, have a classic folk-art feel.

Benjamin Pratt and his friends Jill and Robert are determined to save their school from destruction. But just when it seems they've finally gotten the upper hand over that awful Janitor Lyman, they're caught completely off guard by his next move: Lyman has called in reinforcements, and suddenly Benjamin, Jill, and Robert find themselves dodging not one evil janitor, but two.

Luckily, Ben's team has been growing too. Plus, thank to the latest safeguard, they also have a secret fund of millions of dollars. But all the money in Massachusetts isn't enough to stop Lyman and Wally, not when they've come this far, and not when they are about to put the most harmful part of their plan into play.

Dresses of Red and Gold, the second book in the Melling Sisters Trilogy, is a warm and humorous story of four sisters--their rivalries and their loyalty and affection--growing up in an Australian country town in the 1940s.","[{'author_id': '205124', 'role': ''}]",2017.0,33870995,1,1703510,"Dresses of Red and Gold (The Melling Sisters, #2)","Dresses of Red and Gold (The Melling Sisters, #2)",,,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1484605942m/33870995.jpg

eng,3,4.09,"""An autobiography is a book a person writes about his own life and it is usually full of all sorts of boring details.
This is not an autobiography. I would never write a history of myself. On the other hand, throughout my young days at school and just afterwards a number of things happened to me that I have never forgotten."" -- Roald Dahl
As full of excitement and the unexpected as his world-famous, bestselling books, Roald Dahl's tales of his own childhood are completely fascinating and fiendishly funny. Did you know that Roald Dahl nearly lost his nose in a car accident? Have you heard about his involvement in the Great Mouse Plot of 1924? If not, you don't yet know all there is to know about Roald Dahl. Sure to captivate and delight you, the boyhood antics of this master storyteller are not to be missed!

The story begins with a seed landing in a pretty garden where it starts to grow and eventually forms a little flower bud. But, the little flower bud becomes frightened of things she 'hears on the wind'; such as the sun that might scorch her petals, the rain that might spoil them, the wind that might blow them away - so the flower doesn't want to bloom. However, all flowers must bloom, and as the little flower bud opens her petals she overcomes her fears one by one.
The more we think about our fears, the more they overwhelm us. This book teaches children (of all ages) that fear is just a feeling that holds them back from living their lives to the full.
To add to the fun and develop observational skills there's a 'Did You See' activity page at the back with objects from the book that children may not have noticed whilst reading it. There are also some simple questions that can be asked of children, encouraging them to think about what they've read. The skill level required is 'easy'.","[{'author_id': '7376084', 'role': 'Author/Illustrator'}, {'author_id': '17156458', 'role': 'Author/Illustrator'}]",2017.0,36226869,14,57866453,The Frightened Little Flower Bud,The Frightened Little Flower Bud,,9780993509834,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1505213611m/36226869.jpg

eng,2,4.0,"Source of legend and lyric, reference and conjecture, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is for most children pure pleasure in prose. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing ""The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new."" There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be ""curiouser and curiouser,"" seemingly without moral or sense.
For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully non-moralistic, non-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the ""regular course"" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.","[{'author_id': '8164', 'role': ''}, {'author_id': '180439', 'role': 'Illustrator'}]",1928.0,6948108,10,55548884,Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland,Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland,,,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1266737064m/6948108.jpg

No one in The Community wants for anything. Everyone is provided for. Each Family Unit is entitled to one female and male child. Each member of The Community has their profession carefully chosen for them by the Committee of Elders, and they never make a mistake. Jonas, a sensitive twelve-year-old boy, had never thought there was anything wrong with his Community, until one day. From the moment Jonas is selected as the Receiver of Memory at The Ceremony, his life is never the same. Jonas discovers that The Community is not as perfect as it seems. Although they appear to have everything, they are missing something of great importance. It is up to Jonas, with the help of the Giver, to find what long ago had been lost. And so Jonas embarks on an adventure to save the world as he knows it. Simply and beautifully written, The Giver is sure to touch the heart of every reader. Lois Lowry deals with issues of everyday life that are so often taken for granted. Through the noble character of Jonas, she presents a glimpse of what could be the future. As the tension in the novel mounts, so does the number of questions that Lowry confronts the reader with. The Giver is a book of courage and adventure, and most importantly, one of deep thought. Once readers make contact with Lowry's treasure, they may never see things exactly quite the same. Lowry presents a forceful novel that demands to be heard and philosophically dealt with.

Discovering she has an extraordinary gift for acrobatics, Diamond uses her talent to earn a few pennies, but brings shame on her family.

eng,2,4.14,"Rootabaga Stories(1922) is a children's book of interrelated short stories by Carl Sandburg. The whimsical, sometimes melancholy stories, were originally created for his own daughters. The ""Rootabaga"" stories were born of Sandburg's desire for ""American fairy tales"" to match American childhood. He felt that the European stories involving royalty and knights were inappropriate, and so set his stories in a fictionalized American Midwest called ""the Rootabaga country"" filled with farms, trains, and corn fairies. A large number of the stories are told by the Potato Face Blind Man, an old minstrel of the Village of Liver-and-Onions who hangs out in front of the local post office. His impossibly acquired firsthand knowledge of the stories adds to the books narrative feel and fantastical nature.

Rather than teaching children to obey authority, to conform, or to seek redemption through prayer, twentieth-century leftists encouraged children to question the authority of those in power. Tales for Little Rebels collects forty-three mostly out-of-print stories, poems, comic strips, primers, and other texts for children that embody this radical tradition. These pieces reflect the concerns of twentieth-century leftist movements, like peace, civil rights, gender equality, environmental responsibility, and the dignity of labor. They also address the means of achieving these ideals, including taking collective action, developing critical thinking skills, and harnessing the liberating power of the imagination.
Some of the authors and illustrators are familiar, including Lucille Clifton, Syd Hoff, Langston Hughes, Walt Kelly, Norma Klein, Munro Leaf, Julius Lester, Eve Merriam, Charlotte Pomerantz, Carl Sandburg, and Dr. Seuss. Others are relatively unknown today, but their work deserves to be remembered. (Each of the pieces includes an introduction and a biographical sketch of the author.) From the anti-advertising message of ""Johnny Get Your Money s Worth (and Jane Too)!"" (1938) to the entertaining lessons in ecology provided by ""The Day They Parachuted Cats on Borneo"" (1971), and Sandburg s mockery of war in ""Rootabaga Pigeons"" (1923), these pieces will thrill readers intrigued by politics and history and anyone with a love of children s literature, no matter what age.

Nicky isn't one bit happy about spending the summer with his grandma in the Wisconsin woods; he'd much rather be back in the city. He's not too thrilled about all the chores either--especially fishing. Before long, though, a raft appears in the nearby river, and it changes everything. As Nicky explores, the raft works a subtle magic on the obstinate young boy, opening up the wonders all around him: the animals of river and woods, his grandmother's humor and wisdom, and his own special talent as an artist.
This is a serene story about a summer in the woods, appreciating things--and people--in a whole new light, and discovering one's own talents.

From the moment Joseph the carpenter carves a puppet that can walk and talk, this wildly inventive fantasy takes Pinocchio through countless adventures, in the course of which his nose grows whenever he tells a lie, he is turned into a donkey, and is swallowed by a dogfish, before he gains real happiness.
This new translation does full justice to the vibrancy and wit of Collodi's original. Far more sophisticated, funny, and hard-hitting than the many abridged versions (and the sentimentalized film) of the story would suggest, Ann Lawson Lucas's translation captures the complexity of Collodi's word-play, slapstick humour, and immediacy of dialogue. An adult reader will recognize social and political satire, and the invaluable introduction and notes illuminate the cultural traditions on which Collodi drew.

eng,11,4.05,"In 1877 in Rochester, New York, George Eastman couldn't understand why picture-taking was so difficult. Having left school at fourteen to support his mother and two sisters, George decided to find out by making photography his hobby. He packed up glass plates, a plate holder, a tent, a heavy tripod, a thick piece of black cloth, a water jug, and chemicals and set off to take his first photograph.
George realized that not many people could own a camera -- they were too expensive and the size of today's microwave ovens! But how could he make picture-taking easier? Eventually, George created dry plates, and they were such a success that he opened his own dry-plate company in 1881. But this was only the beginning -- George went on to invent film and the Brownie camera. The rest is history.
Monica Kulling's spunky, playful text is beautifully complemented by the stunning pen-and-ink with watercolor illustrations of artist Bill Slavin. It's a Snap!

Praise for THE TOTALLY SECRET SECRET: *""This early reader has simple, vivacious cartoon artwork done in inks with digital enhancements. Shea's signature style and bright bold colors add to the fun. Although the text is somewhat sophisticated and the dialogue is entirely in word balloons, the humor and theme of friendship and sharing will have broad appeal beyond the beginning reader set. VERDICT Move over Elephant and Piggie!""
--School Library Journal (starred review) *""Tapping into the same barely restrained exuberance and visual energy that characterizes much of his previous work, Shea introduces Ballet Cat, a pearl-and-tutu-wearing feline who loves to dance as much as the author's Dinosaur and Cheetah characters love winning. Like Mo Willems's Elephant and Piggie, these two are a contemporary comic duo with staying power; Shea mines Ballet Cat's dialed-up enthusiasm and Sparkle's hangdog expressions for everything they are worth. Boldly contrasting backgrounds heighten the strong emotions at play and, luckily, after Sparkles reveals his 'secret secret' about dancing, this friendship is undiminished."" --Publishers Weekly (starred review)

Little and is a debonair little character with a shy, engaging manner and a somewhat philosophical turn of mind. He is a great help around the house, and everybody except Snowbell the cat likes him a great deal. In spite of his small size, Stuart gets around in the world, riding a Fifth Avenue bus, racing (and winning in) a sailboat in Central Park, teaching school for a day, and so on. His size -- just over two inches -- does give him some trouble now and then, like the time he was rolled up in the window shade, or when he got dumped into a garbage scow. But on the whole his life is a happy one. His great adventure comes when, at the age of seven, he sets out in the world to seek his dearest friend, Margalo, a beautiful little bird who stayed for a few days in the Littles' Boston fern. It is on this search that we leave Stuart, going north in his little car, sure he is heading in the right direction. 
In this special gift-book edition of a beloved classic, renowned artist Rosemary Wells has lovingly added delicate watercolor to the original black-and-white drawings by Garth Williams.

The first day of middle school means trading in freeze tag at the pool for new schedules, fabulous outfits, and a fresh start. But for eleven-year-old Kaylan, the chaos of new locker combinations, cafeteria cliques, and potential first kisses is more than she can handle. She dreads the start of sixth grade and feels like she wants--no, needs--a winning game plan.
Luckily, Kaylan and her effortlessly chill BFF, Arianna, have a fool-proof plan for tackling transitions: a list of eleven things they need to do to totally transform themselves before they both turn twelve in November. But between making guy friends, getting detention (and makeovers!), helping humanity, and having super-candid conversations with their moms about their flaws, the first 100 days of school turn out worse than Kaylan ever imagined. Kaylan and Ari forget to focus on their friendship and soon their loyalty to the list--what was meant to help them keep it together--becomes the very thing tearing their lives apart.","[{'author_id': '2568433', 'role': ''}]",2017.0,32703393,45,53279763,11 Before 12,11 Before 12,0062411748,9780062411747,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1477314497m/32703393.jpg

Princess Lizzie, the math, science, and technology whiz from a royal palace, once again proves that being a genuine princess doesn't mean you can't also train your brain to do extraordinary things! As savvy at numbers and gadgets as she is with courtly finery, the spirited, spunky princess is determined to put her terrific mind to use to help out others in need. This series of illustrated books for children ages four to eight will captivate inquisitive young minds, while its adult references and gorgeous artwork offer parents plenty of entertainment, too.
Book 3: Princess Lizzie and the Time Travelling Magic Cloak continues the inventive new series, once again starring the clever, courageous royal who finds herself in some very puzzling situations. As before, she must use her wits and compassion to find the right way out of some tricky spots, and rely on a colorful host of animal friends to help her do so. This time, however, the mission at hand may call for breaking the rules at the royal court. Will Princess Lizzie dare to defy the palace?
She feels that she simply must when she learns that her dear friend, Sir Hippo, is in big trouble. Even though the palace strictly forbids time travel, it's the only way she can rescue her tried-and-true companion. When she ventures to other times using her magic cloak infused with the latest technology, she finds herself in unfortunate circumstances and among mysterious characters. Her sassy, super-chatty assistant, Monkey, is ready to help Princess Lizzie, as is her sensible pal Giraffe.
But who is the mysterious creature that dwells just outside the Royal grounds--and is it a friend or foe? And just who is the blind mouse that seems to be able to do just about anything? As young readers become enthralled in the intriguing new characters and the story's many surprises, they will also be moved by the princess's uncommon bravery, empathy, and intelligence. At the same time, the Princess Lizzie series exposes them to topics that are not frequently covered in children's books, such as Princess Lizzie's dilemma over whether to help out a friend if it means breaking the rules of the kingdom.
In addition, Princess Lizzie also demonstrates that being pretty special does not mean that a child needs to be perfect. Each child may confront struggles or weaknesses, but by focusing on his or her strengths, marvelous, magical things are sure to take place. Just follow Princess Lizzie's shining example. When you do, you are bound to discover life lessons, while having a rollicking good time.
By putting their brains together, and tapping into the latest technology, the three friends prove that anything is possible when you have the confidence and support to solve perplexing problems. Young children will hang on every twist in the plot, and along the way learn the power of friendship, caring for those less fortunate, and making use of wits and innovation to save the day!

In this short book alone, the three youngsters encounter a greedy and repulsive villain, itchy clothing, a disastrous fire, a plot to steal their fortune, and cold porridge for breakfast.

From an acorn of an idea about a real-life good Samaritan of yesteryear, the author has crafted a satisfying, if occasionally painful, novel that spans the lives of several fortunate and unfortunate young people of the day.The author has researched her backdrop very well, and the atmospheric sights and sounds of the time are both vivid and captivating. Readers will smell the dirty streets and close-living of urban London, revel in the summer splendour of the finest country houses and then flinch when the harshness of life for the poorest souls is revealed in uncomfortable detail.
For in the late 1700s your circumstance of birth meant everything. Toby and Aaron may both find themselves living at Captain Thomas Coram's Hospital for parentless children, but their histories are as far apart as they could possibly be. Toby has been rescued from a life of slave labour in a faraway country; Aaron is the illegitimate son of the heir to a large country estate. They are watched over by Mish--a simple soul who has been with them since their arrival. His devotion to them is absolute, but his motives are not altogether straightforward. Could this curious man really be Meshak, the son of a wicked child-killer who was hanged at the gallows for his crimes?
Coram Boyis a glorious web of changing fortunes and subtle intrigues. There is tragedy and corruption, hope and evil. Sometimes brutal and sometimes unceasingly bleak, the genre of historical fiction has rarely been this good. It's undoubtedly the kind of book that wins awards.

The farmers in this case are a vaguely criminal team of three stooges: ""Boggis and Bunce and Bean / One fat, one short, one lean. / These horrible crooks / So different in looks / Were nonetheless equally mean."" Whatever their prowess as poultry farmers, within these pages their sole objective is the extermination of our hero--the noble, the clever, the Fantastic Mr. Fox. Our loyalties are defined from the start; after all, how could you cheer for a man named Bunce who eats his doughnuts stuffed with mashed goose livers? As one might expect, the farmers in this story come out smelling like ... well, what farmers occasionally do smell like.
This early Roald Dahl adventure is great for reading aloud to three- to seven-year-olds, who will be delighted to hear that Mr. Fox keeps his family one step ahead of the obsessed farmers. When they try to dig him out, he digs faster; when they lay siege to his den, he tunnels to where the farmers least expect him--their own larders! In the end, Mr. Fox not only survives, but also helps the whole community of burrowing creatures live happily ever after. With his usual flourish, Dahl evokes a magical animal world that, as children, we always knew existed, had we only known where or how to look for it.

The adventures of Alice-named for one of the little girls to whom the book was dedicated-who journeys down a rabbit hole and into a whimsical underworld realm instantly struck a chord with the British public, and then with readers around the world. In 1872, in reaction to the universal acclaim *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* received, Dodgson published this sequel. Nothing is quite what it seems once Alice journeys through the looking-glass, and Dodgson's wit is infectious as he explores concepts of mirror imagery, time running backward, and strategies of chess-all wrapped up in the exploits of a spirited young girl who parries with the Red Queen, Tweedledee and Tweedledum, and other unlikely characters. In many ways, this sequel has had an even greater impact on today's pop culture than the first book.","[{'author_id': '8164', 'role': ''}, {'author_id': '4055248', 'role': 'Illustrator'}]",,28477633,38,45962572,Alice Through the Looking Glass,Alice Through the Looking Glass,1925081710,9781925081718,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1464049835m/28477633.jpg

""Why were there no gifts from the wild animals?"" asks one of the characters, and the author replies that there were such offerings and proceeds to the central theme of the story. The Fox in the Manger is a delightful mixture of gaiety, gravity, poetry and common sense by the author of the popular Mary Poppins books.

""There is something about everything that you can be glad about, if you keep hunting long enough to find it.""
When Pollyanna Whittier's father dies, she is sent to live with her Aunt Polly in Vermont.
A clash of personalities ensues as Pollyanna's sunny disposition sits ill with her aunt's need for quiet, her passion for shutting windows, and her obsession with quietly shut doors. The key to Pollyanna's happiness is The Glad GameOCooriginally invented to deal with disappointing missionary boxesOCoand is applied to all parts of life. No matter how dark the situation, it is always possible to find something to be glad about. Any attempts to discipline the child fail helplessly in the face of The Glad Game. A bread and milk supper in the kitchen is greeted with rapture; a puritan attic bedroom with sparse furnishing is valued for its rapturous views. As Pollyanna becomes acquainted with other inhabitants of the town, the cantankerous residents fall victim to her charms. However, the arrival of a motor car in town heralds a tragic change which not even Pollyanna looks likely to be able to overcome.

Academy Award nominee Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction) rocks this mock bedtime story, capturing a hilarious range of emotions as the voice of a father struggling to get his child to sleep.
Go the F**k to Sleep is a bedtime book for parents who live in the real world, where a few snoozing kitties and cutesy rhymes don't always send a toddler sailing blissfully off to dreamland. California Book Award-winning author Adam Mansbach's profane, affectionate, and radically honest verses perfectly capture the familiar - and unspoken - tribulations of putting your little angel down for the night. In the process, he opens up a conversation about parenting, granting us permission to admit our frustrations and laugh at their absurdity.
Beautiful, subversive, and pants-wettingly funny, Go the F**k to Sleep is a book for parents new, old, and expectant. Due to its explicit language, you probably should not play it for your children.
Go the F**k to Sleep is available free until July 14. Feel free to share the link to this page with tired parents and other people who could use a good swear and a laugh.

eng,18,4.0,"Source of legend and lyric, reference and conjecture, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is for most children pure pleasure in prose. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing ""The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new."" There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be ""curiouser and curiouser,"" seemingly without moral or sense.
For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully non-moralistic, non-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the ""regular course"" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.","[{'author_id': '8164', 'role': ''}]",2010.0,10372031,165,55548884,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,,,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1395209643m/10372031.jpg

(Olga D'Agostino), author of children's picture books CARLO THE MOUSE ON VACATION and THE TREES HAVE HEARTS, grew up on a farm in a village nestled in the beautiful Carpathian Mountains in western Ukraine. Surrounded by nature and the real world, without TV and toys, she learned to read at a very early age, and books then became a huge part of her life. As a child, she used to create her own imaginary world populated with characters from books she read. She fi nished business college in Lviv, Ukraine. To escape the harsh reality of life in the Soviet Union, she immigrated to the United States in 1992 with her two small daughters. For many years she worked in her own business. While practicing English, she wrote many children's stories. Those close to her encouraged her to publish some of her stories.","[{'author_id': '5246750', 'role': ''}]",2013.0,18055284,20,25344386,The City Kittens and the Old House Cat,The City Kittens and the Old House Cat,1457516195,9781457516191,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1371330421m/18055284.jpg

They both agreed that they will take a journey through the desert to the amazing oasis. However, on their way, they experience some difficulties that puts their friendship to the test.

When Eden finds a gateway to Earth within the lamp, she takes her chance and enters the world she loves. And this time, she won't be sent back after three wishes.
Posing as the new kid at a California middle school, Eden revels in all of Earth's pleasures--but quickly learns that this world isn't as perfect as she always thought it was. Eden soon finds herself in the middle of a centuries-old conflict between powerful immortals. A ruthless organization run by a former genie will stop at nothing to acquire the lamp and its power--even hurt Tyler and Sasha, the new mortal friends who have given Eden a home. To save her friends and protect the lamp's magic, Eden must decide once and for all where she belongs.","[{'author_id': '12260635', 'role': ''}]",2015.0,24397045,144,43981605,"Eden's Wish (Eden of the Lamp, #1)","Eden's Wish (Eden of the Lamp, #1)",1484711858,9781484711859,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1440255653m/24397045.jpg

I'm sorry to say that the book you are holding in your hands is extremely unpleasant. It tells an unhappy tale about three very unlucky children. Even though they are charming and clever, the Baudelaire siblings lead lives filled with misery and woe. From the very first page of this book when the children are at the beach and receive terrible news, continuing on through the entire story, disaster lurks at their heels. One might say they are magnets for misfortune.
In this short book alone, the three youngsters encounter a greedy and repulsive villain, itchy clothing, a disastrous fire, a plot to steal their fortune, and cold porridge for breakfast.
It is my sad duty to write down these unpleasant tales, but there is nothing stopping you from putting this book down at once and reading something happy, if you prefer that sort of thing.

She would prefer to stay home and sleep, but when her friend takes off on one of his adventures, she follows - mainly to keep the dog out of trouble. Patchy does not necessarily look for trouble, instead it usually finds him.
In ""A Ghostly Adventure,"" Patchy and Calico receive some surprises as they prepare for Halloween and learn some valuable lessons along the way. They discover that trick or treating means more than receiving treats. The two friends also learn that it doesn't matter what a person looks like on the outside, it's what's on the inside that counts. Patchy's big adventure involves finding a ghost. He does, but it does not go exactly as he wished.
""A Ghostly Adventure"" is the fourth book in the Patchwork Dog and Calico Cat series. All four books contain five stories with questions at the end of each tale to help children comprehend what they have read. There are color illustrations at the beginning of each chapter hinting at what the new adventure will be about, as well as other pictures at the end of each story. These books are targeted for elementary age children, but can be read to younger kids as bedtime stories as well. Patchy and Calico will entertain children of all ages and hopefully teach youngsters some valuable lessons about working together and staying out of trouble.","[{'author_id': '4173006', 'role': ''}]",2015.0,27281178,5,47336577,A Ghostly Adventure (Patchwork Dog and Calico Cat Book 4),A Ghostly Adventure (Patchwork Dog and Calico Cat Book 4),B0175CAORO,,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1445885026m/27281178.jpg

Add his impressively lazy business partner, a very large polar bear named Total. Throw in the Failuremobile -- Timmy's mom's Segway -- and what you have is Total Failure, Inc., a global enterprise destined to make Timmy so rich his mother won't have to stress out about the bills anymore.

Suzy is twelve when her best friend, Franny, drowns one summer at the beach. It takes two days for the news to reach Suzy, and it's not something that she can accept: Franny has always been a strong swimmer, from the day they met in swim class when they were just 5. How can someone all of a sudden, just no longer be there?
Suzy realizes that they must have got it wrong: Franny didn't just drown - she was stung by a poisonous jellyfish. This makes a lot more sense to Suzy's logical mind than a random drowning - cause: a jellyfish sting; effect: death.
Suzy's journey to acceptance is quiet - she resolves to either say something important, or say nothing at all. But it's also bursting with bittersweet humour, heart-breaking honesty, big ideas and small details.

Understood Betsy is a 1916 novel for children by Dorothy Canfield Fisher. Originally published in 1917, this novel follows the adventure of Elizabeth Ann, an orphan who leaves a privileged urban lifestyle with her cousin to live with the Putney's on a Vermont farm. Elizabeth Ann, nicknamed Betsy, lives with her father's aunt, Harriet, who expects her to lead a very sheltered life. When she is sent to live with her mother's family, on a farm in Vermont, she is then expected to do many of the chores that Harriet had thought too demanding of a little girl. Betsy discovers her own abilities and gains a new perception of the world around her.
Dorothy Canfield Fisher (1879 - 1958) was an educational reformer, social activist, and best-selling American author in the early decades of the twentieth century. She strongly supported women's rights, racial equality, and lifelong education. She was named by Eleanor Roosevelt as one of the ten most influential women in the United States.","[{'author_id': '199175', 'role': ''}, {'author_id': '3105124', 'role': 'Illustrator'}]",2013.0,21400638,16,3234038,Understood Betsy: with Original Illustrations by Ada Clendenin Williamson,Understood Betsy: with Original Illustrations by Ada Clendenin Williamson,,,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1394234666m/21400638.jpg

When the Baudelaire Orphans finally make it out of Count Olaf's car trunk (from Book the Eighth), they wind up at the horribly perilous Caligari Carnival. Trying to avoid capture but desperate to find out more information about a possible surviving parent, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny pose as circus freaks, only to be humiliated in front of visitors and pushed to the brink of consumption by lions. Fortunately, though, the three discover a few surprises about fortune-telling Madame Lulu, who offers a faint clue about V.F.D. and even the Snicket family itself.
Snicket fans will be in Ninth Heaven. Again, it's a sad state of affairs for the Baudelaires, but there are some fascinating morsels of hope, plus a few small surprises that might help link it all together.

It is a place where you wash your shadow and plant diamond gardens, a place where shoes fly, sisters are auctioned off, and crocodiles go to the dentist.
Shel Silverstein's masterful collection of poems and drawings is one of Parent & Child magazine's 100 Greatest Books for Kids. School Library Journal said, ""Silverstein has an excellent sense of rhythm and rhyme and a good ear for alliteration and assonance that make these poems a pleasure to read aloud.""
Shel Silverstein's incomparable career as a children's book author and illustrator began with Lafcadio, the Lion Who Shot Back. In 1964, Shel's creativity continued to flourish as four more books were published in the same year--Don't Bump the Glump!, A Giraffe and a Half, Who Wants a Cheap Rhinoceros?, and the beloved classic The Giving Tree. Later he continued to build his remarkable body of work with Where the Sidewalk Ends, A Light in the Attic, Falling Up, Every Thing On It, The Missing Piece, The Missing Piece Meets the Big O, and Runny Babbit.","[{'author_id': '435477', 'role': ''}]",,20322241,107,30518,Where the Sidewalk Ends,Where the Sidewalk Ends,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

the prince and knights (populars), ogres and giants (jocks), and even the lowly minstrels (band geeks). Plus, trolls aren't exactly known for their brain power or cool demeanor. But it gets worse. When the king disappears and Zarf's archenemy, the prince, ascends the throne, he makes Zarf's life even moremiserable. And so it is that Zarf and his two sidekicks (a neurotic, mutton-obsessed pig and the not-funny son of the court jester) set out to find the missing king as well as their way to middle school heroism.

However, when he is four David and Polly realise that the violin is his instrument, and he begins taking lessons, and practising up to four hours a day. Because of his violin lessons, Sebastian cannot go to a normal school, so David and Polly engage a governess to teach all the children - Miss Popple, who soon becomes known as Popps.
At the suggestion of his violin teacher, David and Polly allow Sebastian to play at a musicians' charity event when he is eight. As a result of this, an important American concert arranger makes an offer for Sebastian to tour America, accompanied by his father. The tour will finish in California, where a great violin master lives: the income from the tour will be enough to pay for lessons. At first Polly refuses, not wanting to break up the family. However, a new offer is made, for the whole family, and Miss Popple, to travel with Sebastian. David and Polly think this will be a wonderful experience for the children, so they agree. Apple Bough is sold, Myra's dog, Wag, is left with Miss Popple's brother, and the family set off for America.

eng,8,4.03,"In the tradition of The Adventures of Peter Rabbit, this is a ""garden tale"" of farmer versus vermin, or vice versa. The farmers in this case are a vaguely criminal team of three stooges: ""Boggis and Bunce and Bean / One fat, one short, one lean. / These horrible crooks / So different in looks / Were nonetheless equally mean."" Whatever their prowess as poultry farmers, within these pages their sole objective is the extermination of our hero--the noble, the clever, the Fantastic Mr. Fox. Our loyalties are defined from the start; after all, how could you cheer for a man named Bunce who eats his doughnuts stuffed with mashed goose livers? As one might expect, the farmers in this story come out smelling like ... well, what farmers occasionally do smell like.This early Roald Dahl adventure is great for reading aloud to three- to seven-year-olds, who will be delighted to hear that Mr. Fox keeps his family one step ahead of the obsessed farmers. When they try to dig him out, he digs faster; when they lay siege to his den, he tunnels to where the farmers least expect him--their own larders! In the end, Mr. Fox not only survives, but also helps the whole community of burrowing creatures live happily ever after. With his usual flourish, Dahl evokes a magical animal world that, as children, we always knew existed, had we only known where or how to look for it. (Great read aloud for any age; written at a 9- to 12-year-old reading level)","[{'author_id': '4273', 'role': ''}, {'author_id': '2824788', 'role': 'Illustrator'}]",1970.0,2146001,31,44775,Fantastic Mr. Fox,Fantastic Mr. Fox,0394904974,9780394904979,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1294253431m/2146001.jpg

eng,3,4.5,"The adventure begins over two hundred years ago, when Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed his Perfekte Symphonie. He used ink made from pure gold to create each and every note. So extraordinary were the golden notes that they jumped right off the pages of the manuscript and ran away, seeking fame, fortune and adventure across the globe.
Today, there's only one detective in the world who can bring them back together. He's a talented musician who can play any instrument. He's a brilliant detective who can solve any mystery. And he's only three-inches tall. A three-inch tall mouse to be exact - who goes by the name of T.W. Strouse.
In ""The Case of The Haunted Swamp,"" strange sounds are emanating from deep within the Louisiana Bayou. Could the source be Mozart's legendary Golden Notes? T.W. Strouse travels into the foreboding bayou to get to the murky bottom of the musical mystery.
""The Case of the Haunted Swamp"" chronicles the search for Mozart's golden notes and is written by Hollywood veterans Cliff MacGillivray and Kelly Ward. The pair has written hundreds of scripts for Disney, Warner Bros., MGM, Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon. Celebrated artist and writer Phil Mendez, whose book ""The Black Snowman"" has sold over 2 million copies, provided the lavish illustrations. Talented colorist Hunter Wolf digitally colored the art.

Ten years on, Kate, Michael and Emma have grown up in a string of miserable orphanages, and all memories of their parents have faded to a blur. Arriving at Cambridge Falls, the children quickly realise there is something different about this place - and Kate feels sure she has seen the dark, crooked house before.

From the page preceding the title page;
""The myths of the Northmen, from the ice and snow of the Scandinavian countries, tell how in the beginning there was only the Yawning Void, which they called Ginnungagap, but deep in the Void lay the Well of Life. In course of time ice piled over the Well, and out of it grew something they called Ymir, the father of the terrible Frost Giants. Ymir was fed on the milk of a magic cow who licked the ice, and with it salt from the Well of Life. As she licked with her tongue, she formed the first of the gods, the AEsir, who was called Buri. Buri had a son Borr, and Borr was the father of Odin. Odin and his brothers overcame the ice and frost giants. They thrust Ymir down into the Yawning Void, and of his body they made the world we live in. They set the sea in a ring about the world, and planted the World Tree, the Ash Yggdrasill, to hold it in place.
From this making of the world, to Ragnarok, the last Great Battle, Roger Lancelyn Green tells the story in one continuous narrative. It is easy to read, and there is a clear rhythm carrying through to the final climax. He has taken his material from original sources, of which he gives a brief account in his foreword. ""

eng,1,3.99,"Charles Dickens wrote The Life of Our Lordaround the same time he was finishing up David Copperfield, but to readers raised on a diet of Dickensian wit and indignation, his rendering of Jesus' life may come as something of a surprise. You won't find even the shadow of a Micawber or a Mrs. Gamp anywhere in this brief volume; no Pecksniffs, Podsnaps, or Mulberries, either. Instead, Dickens approaches his subject with simple reverence, retelling the New Testament in a manner suitable for his own young children--who were, in fact, his only intended audience. Indeed, he strictly forbade publication of The Lifeduring his lifetime and begged his sister to make sure that they ""would never even hand the manuscript, or a copy of it, to anyone to take out of the house."" It wasn't until the death of Dickens's last living son that the manuscript was finally published in 1934. Though he left his trademark comedy behind, Dickens's liberal social conscience is still evident in what he chooses to emphasize about Jesus: ""My Dear Children,"" he begins, I am very anxious that you should know something about the History of Jesus Christ. For everybody ought to know about Him. No one ever lived who was so good, so kind, so gentle, and so sorry for all people who did wrong, or were in any way ill or miserable, as He was.This is a simple, straightforward account of Jesus' life and teachings, with an occasional touch of whimsy: ""You never saw a locust, because they belong to that country near Jerusalem, which is a great way off. So do camels, but I think you have seen a camel. At all events, they are brought over here, sometimes; and if you would like to see one, I will show you one."" Occasionally, Victorian attitudes and prejudices creep through--Dickens writes that the Jewish Sabbath was Sunday, that Jews were ""very ignorant and passionate,"" and also that ""they were very proud, and believed that no people were good but themselves."" Fortunately, such comments are few and far between, and for the most part the author focuses on the miracles Jesus performed and on the lessons in charity, forgiveness, and compassion that Christians can take away from them. This may not be among the greatest of Charles Dickens's literary accomplishments, but it is certainly one of his most heartfelt. --Sheila Bright","[{'author_id': '239579', 'role': ''}]",,25108031,1,1880450,The Life of Our Lord: Written for His Children During the Years 1846 to 1849,The Life of Our Lord: Written for His Children During the Years 1846 to 1849,,,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1425939229m/25108031.jpg

When his family decided not to go away for the summer, young Tommy got a job. He collected all the neighbors' plants, promising to care for them throughout the summer. Soon Tommy's house was unrecognizable. Watching television was like watching an outdoor movie deep in the jungle, and taking a bath was like swimming in a small lake in the middle of a forest. Tommy's parents were not particularly enthusiastic about their son's career, but the plants flourished.
One night Tommy had a dream that the plants had grown too big to fit in the house. The next day some research at the library revealed his worries. When the neighbors returned they were delighted to see their healthy plants. And Tommy was delighted when his father suggested a vacation for the plant sitter and his family.

Inspired by a traditional African folktale, this is the story of Mufaro, who is proud of his two beautiful daughters. Nyasha is kind and considerate, but everyone--except Mufaro--knows that Manyara is selfish and bad-tempered.
When the Great King decides to take a wife and invites the most worthy and beautiful daughters in the land to appear before him, Mufaro brings both of his daughters--but only one can be queen. Who will the king choose?
Award-winning artist John Steptoe's rich cultural imagery of Africa earned him the Coretta Scott King Award for Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters. The book also went on to win the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award. This stunning story is a timeless treasure that readers will enjoy for generations.

This children's rhyming book was inspired by a true story, and details the experience of a father and son who learned this lesson while visiting a local amusement park. There, they meet Fat Freddy, a highly trained penguin who was rewarded with a fish and a hug each time he performed a trick correctly. The father learns a valuable lesson about recognizing and rewarding good behavior after watching the show. He realizes that doing so is more effective than punishing or giving attention to negative behavior, and in turn, changes the way he manages his own son. The result is a closer, stronger relationship. This book is both entertaining as well as a valuable educational tool, and is recommended for children and adults alike.

But when the bold Prince Zorn of Zorna arrives, disguised as a wandering minstrel, and helped by the enigmatic Golux, the cold Duke may at last have met his match.

Pippi Longstocking is nine years old. She has just moved into Villa Villekulla where she lives all by herself with a horse, a monkey, and a big suitcase full of gold coins. The grown-ups in the village try to make Pippi behave in ways that they think a little girl should, but Pippi has other ideas. She would much rather spend her days arranging wild, exciting adventures to enjoy with her neighbours, Tommy and Annika, or entertaining everyone she meets with her outrageous stories. Pippi thinks nothing of wrestling a circus strongman, dancing a polka with burglars, or tugging a bull's tail.
Generations of children have fallen in love with Pippi Longstocking. Just like Tommy and Annika, readers are instantly charmed by her warmth and sense of fun.
Astrid Lindgren's children's classic first appeared in 1945. Astrid once commented, 'I write to amuse the child within me, and can only hope that other children may have some fun that way, too.' When she was growing up, Lauren Child loved Astrid Lindgren's books. She remembers: 'I discovered Pippi when I was about eight years old and found her completely inspiring.' Known and loved as the creator of some equally feisty little girls - notably Clarice Bean and Lola - Lauren has brought her own inimitable style to this beautifully-illustrated edition of Pippi Longstocking.

He pulled the curtains open wider this time and peered out. At first he saw nothing, but then he noticed the strange marks on the lawn. All over, the grass was churned up and muddy as if something heavy had been racing around on it. Then he saw it. A creature standing at the end of the garden. Just under the apple tree, next to the back garden gate, was a little silver dinosaur with a long whip tail and a slender neck. It cocked its head to one side, blinked and looked right at him.

Before she can even unpack, strange music coming from behind a padlocked door leads Fairday up a spiral staircase and into a secret room, where an ancient mirror, a brass key, and a strange picture of a red-haired lady are the first in a series of clues that takes the members of the Detective Mystery Squad on an amazing adventure.","[{'author_id': '5757964', 'role': ''}, {'author_id': '6450256', 'role': 'author/illustrator'}]",,13496301,13,19039284,The Secret Files of Fairday Morrow,The Secret Files of Fairday Morrow,,,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1331144436m/13496301.jpg

When Pip's English teacher challenges her students to learn how to juggle three balls, Pip is determined that he will do better than that.

I'm 9 years old and I live in a small town in the United States with my annoying older sister Zoey, my dog Rupert, and my parents. I go to school nearby. Over the years I have learnt a lot about life and how to handle things at home and at school.
In this collection of 10 short stories (also available individually and as 5 packs) you get:
Maddy's Guide to Life: Elevator Farts
This funny short story is about the day that Joey came to school after having eaten too many beans the day before. Not only did we all want gas masks to cope with the smell, but it got worse when someone got trapped in an elevator with him. Boy, was that a day to remember!
Maddy's Guide to Life: Halloween
In this funny story, Zoey had some hungry friends over for Halloween. I had my friend Michael, and his pet frog, over. I guess you could say that the evening didn't turn out quite how Zoey expected...but Michael and I did end up with lots of candy. Read the story to find out what happened.
Maddy's Guide to Life: Boogers
In this funny story, Amanda (you know, the so called 'coolest' girl) made a big mistake. She thought the green stuff on Mr. Wrong's sushi was Joey's booger. I don't want to give the whole story away, but what I can tell you is that this led to complete chaos in the classroom. It was pretty funny.
Maddy's Guide to Life: Bullying
Joey's the really annoying kid in our class who farts and plays pranks on everyone. Do you know the type? Well, one day Joey got bullied by some mean big kids. This story shows how by sticking up for each other we can overcome the bullies.
Maddy's Guide to Life: Divorce
I've told you about Amanda before. You know, she's the girl who thinks she's really cool and who isn't that nice to most of the rest of us in the class. One day Amanda got told that her parents were getting a divorce. She wasn't like the old Amanda after that as she blamed herself and felt really angry. I was so glad that we were able to help her get through the bad feelings. That day we all found strengths we didn't know we had.
Maddy's Guide to Life: Family Parties
Zoey was having a boring family birthday party and all I wanted was to admire the food before the guests turned up. Well, things went a little bit wrong (okay, okay - a big bit wrong). All I can say was that Rupert was a big help in cleaning things up.
Maddy's Guide to Life: Facebook Expert
I really needed a new iPad for Christmas but it was so hard trying to get mom to understand this and then things got worse when Zoey found out that I had been into her Facebook account. I'm not sure why, but Zoey didn't appreciate the changes I made to her account.
Maddy's Guide to Life: School Camp
I decided that school camp would be the perfect opportunity for me to take over from Amanda, Pamela and Nancy to become the coolest girl in class. Marshmallows, Dora the Explorer, and a frog meant that things didn't go according to plan, but it turned out that at least one kid thinks I'm great and that's cool.
Maddy's Guide to Life: Bring a Pet to School Day
For Bring a Pet Day I brought my dog Rupert to school. I forgot to ask mom first. Other kids brought pink dyed Chihuahuas, a pet rat, a frog and a psycho cat. Things were going well for a few minutes but then it all went badly wrong. You won't believe what happened to the teacher and the principal! Anyway, it all got sorted out in the end.
Maddy's Guide to Life: School Lunches
Not only was school really boring that day, but then when we had to line up to get lunch in the school cafeteria the food looked really disgusting. It was so gloopy and it looked like something Rupert made. A small frog soon put an end to the lunch food and the day ended up being the best day ever.","[{'author_id': '5752533', 'role': ''}]",,14059594,8,19695929,maddy's guide to life: The omnibus Edition,maddy's guide to life: The omnibus Edition,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

His letters to his son are also full of great stories about the past -- what the first date with his mother was like (it included a visit to a fortune teller and a bizarre circus) and about how the boy's life was saved twice by this very same dad -- once when he was stolen from his baby basket by a dog and once when he flew out the car window. But as his mother says, his dad has ants in his pants, which means he's often not around.
Still, life rolls along with one fantastical tale after another, in good times and bad. And this is this extraordinary father's gift to his child -- the life of the imagination -- which is always with him, even when his father is not.

Oswald is a favorite. Of all the toys in Billy's home, the stuffed rabbit takes top rank: everywhere Billy goes, so goes Oz. But being a favorite is more than a privilege--it's also fraught with danger. Because of Zozo.

The story of the The Gremlinsconcerns the mischievous mythical creatures of the title, often invoked by Royal Air Force pilots as an explanation of mechanical troubles and mishaps. In Dahl's book, the gremlins' motivation for sabotaging British aircraft is revenge of the destruction of their forest home, which was razed to make way for an aircraft factory. The principal character in the book, Gus, has his Hawker Hurricane fighter destroyed over the English Channel by a gremlin, but is able to convince the gremlins as they parachute into the water that they should join forces against a common enemy, Hitler and the Nazis, rather than fight each other.

The island of Manhattan doesn't exactly inspire new beginnings, but Thyme tries to embrace the change for what it is: temporary.
After Val's treatment shows real promise and Mr. Owens accepts a full-time position in the city, Thyme has to face the frightening possibility that the move to New York is permanent. Thyme loves her brother, and knows the trial could save his life--she'd give anything for him to be well--but she still wants to go home, although the guilt of not wanting to stay is agonizing. She finds herself even more mixed up when her heart feels the tug of new friends, a first crush and even a crotchety neighbor and his sweet whistling bird. All Thyme can do is count the minutes, the hours and the days, and hope time can bring both a miracle for Val and a way back home.

The colors and details of the watercolors in the volumes are reproduced more accurately than ever before, and it has now been possible to disguise damage that has affected the artwork over the years. Most notably, 'The Tale of Peter Rabbit' restores six of Potter's original illustrations. Four were sacrificed in 1903 to make space for illustrated endpapers, and two have never been used before.
Of course, Beatrix Potter created many memorable children's characters, including Benjamin Bunny, Tom Kitten, Jemima Puddle-duck and Jeremy Fisher.

Have you been unexpectedly burdened by a recently orphaned or unclaimed creature? Worry not! We have just the solution for you!
Welcome to the Home for Wayward and Misbegotten Creatures, an institution run by evil Miss Carbunkle, a cunning villainess who believes her terrified young charges exist only to serve and suffer. Part animal and part human, the groundlings toil in classroom and factory, forbidden to enjoy anything regular children have, most particularly singing and music. For the Wonderling, an innocent-hearted, one-eared, fox-like eleven-year-old with only a number rather than a proper name -- a 13 etched on a medallion around his neck -- it is the only home he has ever known. But unexpected courage leads him to acquire the loyalty of a young bird groundling named Trinket, who gives the Home's loneliest inhabitant two incredible gifts: a real name -- Arthur, like the good king in the old stories -- and a best friend. Using Trinket's ingenious invention, the pair escape over the wall and embark on an adventure that will take them out into the wider world and ultimately down the path of sweet Arthur's true destiny. Richly imagined, with shimmering language, steampunk motifs, and gripping, magical plot twists, this high adventure fantasy is the debut novel of award-winning memoirist Mira Bartok and has already been put into development for a major motion picture.","[{'author_id': '102385', 'role': ''}]",2017.0,34427284,8,45975969,The Wonderling,The Wonderling,0763691216,9780763691219,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498799927m/34427284.jpg

Poor Jemima. All she wants to do is lay her eggs in peace, and be allowed to hatch them herself. At last she flies off and finds the perfect place. Little does the silly duck realise that the charming gentleman who has lent her his woodshed is busily planning a delicious meal of . . . roast duck!
Jemima was a real duck belonging to Beatrix Potter, who lived at her farm, Hill Top. The story also features Beatrix's own sheepdog, Kep, who thankfully manages to save Jemima from a nasty fate!
Beatrix Potter is regarded as one of the world's best-loved children's authors of all time. From her first book, The Tale of Peter Rabbit, published by Frederick Warne in 1902, she went on to create a series of stories based around animal characters including Mrs. Tiggy-winkle, Benjamin Bunny, Jemima Puddle-duck, Mr. Jeremy Fisher and Tom Kitten.
Her humorous, lively tales and beautiful illustrations have become a natural part of childhood. With revenue from the sales of her books, Beatrix Potter bought a farm - Hill Top - in the English Lake District, where she later became a farmer and prize-winning sheep breeder. She launched the now vast merchandise programme by patenting the very first Peter Rabbit doll in 1903. The product range continues to grow today with licences around the world including baby clothing and bedding, nursery decor products and collectables. Upon her death, Beatrix Potter left 14 farms and over 4000 acres of Lake District farmland to the National Trust so that the place that she loved would remain undeveloped and protected for future generations to enjoy.
Today Beatrix Potter's original 23 tales are still published by Frederick Warne, alongside a wide range of other formats including baby books, activity books and gift and sound books.
The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duckis number nine in Beatrix Potter's series of 23 little books. Look out for the rest!

While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing ""The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new.""

For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully non-moralistic, non-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the ""regular course"" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.

Why Horrid Henry?
Kids love it!
""I love the Horrid Henry books by Francesca Simon. They have lots of funny bits in. And Henry always gets into trouble!""
Mia, age 6, BBC Learning is Fun
""It's easy to see why Horrid Henry is the bestselling character for 5-8 year olds.""
Liverpool Echo
Because it's funny
""My two boys love this book and I have actually had tears running down my face and had to stop reading because of laughing so hard. My oldest son is rereading all the books in this series on his own now and he still loves them. Happy reading!""
T. Franklin, Parent
""A modern comic classic.""
SF Said, Guardian Children's Books Supplement 
Kids get to be harmlessly rebellious
""Henry is a beguiling hero who has entranced millions of reluctant readers... little rebels will love this collection and even little angels will be secretly thrilled by Henry's anti-heroic behaviour.""
Herald
Henry's naughtiness is a yardstick against which children can get a sense of their own moral goodness and social justice
""What is brilliant about the books is that Henry never does anything that is subversive. She creates an aura of supreme naughtiness (of which children are in awe) but points out that he operates within a safe and secure world.""
Emily Turner, Angels And Urchins Magazine
Reaches the most important age group - children who are learning to read
""I have tried out the Horrid Henry books with groups of children as a parent, as a babysitter, and as a teacher. Children love to either hear them read aloud or to read them themselves. The books are spot on for the 5-8 age range and are fun for the adults who share them too.""
Danielle Hall, Teacher
The structure provides new readers with a real sense of accomplishment
""My son is 7 years old and a big Horrid Henry fan. This book lived up to his expectations! Horrid Henry is like most boys: he always has a plan and is always getting into mischief! It was amusing, and he could not put it down. Can't wait for the next. He read it cover to cover by himself in 2 days! That for me sells a book! He can't wait for the next one to be published. He has recommended it to all his friends.""
Mrs. Tami Gold, Parent
Reaches both boys and girls equally
""Wonderfully appealing to girls and boys alike, a precious rarity at this age.""

The Guardian

From the Author:
I write children's books to help brighten the lives of children and add a little dollop of wisdom in the process. Children need good habits, handy skills, and a good sense of humor to keep them moving forward in a happy, healthy, and productive manner. As a King Featuressyndicated author, I have been creating positive and inspirational messages, called ""Happy Musings""for newspapers in the U.S. and Canada for many years. This has led to my writing and illustrating a great number of uplifting books for both adults and children. Along with my writing and illustrating, I have created collections of wallpaperfor children baby bibs, t-shirtsand a vast number of prints and original art for children's rooms.

Her guardian tells her it is almost impossible that her mother is still alive--but ""almost impossible"" means ""still possible."" And you should never ignore a possible.
So when the Welfare Agency writes to her guardian, threatening to send Sophie to an orphanage, she takes matters into her own hands and flees to Paris to look for her mother, starting with the only clue she has-- the address of the cello maker.
Evading the French authorities, she meets Matteo and his network of rooftoppers--urchins who live in the hidden spaces above the city.

""This is Thunder Cake baking weather,"" calls Grandma, as she and her granddaughter hurry to gather the ingredients around the farm. A real Thunder Cake must reach the oven before the storm arrives. But the list of ingredients is long and not easy to find . . . and the storm is coming closer all the time!
Reaching once again into her rich childhood experience, Patricia Polacco tells the memorable story of how her grandma--her Babushka--helped her overcome her fear of thunder when she was a little girl. Ms. Polacco's vivid memories of her grandmother's endearing answer to a child's fear, accompanied by her bright folk-art illustrations, turn a frightening thunderstorm into an adventure and ultimately . . . a celebration!
Whether the first clap of thunder finds you buried under the bedcovers or happily anticipating the coming storm, Thunder Cake is a story that will bring new meaning and possibility to the excitement of a thunderstorm.","[{'author_id': '46688', 'role': ''}]",1990.0,1406179,97,432405,Thunder Cake,Thunder Cake,0399222316,9780399222313,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png
eng,1,3.97,"A dramatic, vividly illustrated look at the tragic ship whose fiery crash ended the age of the dirigible.
Like a fabulous silvery fish, floating quietly in the ocean of air ... it seemed to be coming from another world and to be returning there like a dream.
On May 6, 1937, the Hindenburg, the largest and fastest airship ever built, exploded in a tremendous ball of fire as it came to land in Lakehurst, New Jersey. It was one of the most spectacular disasters of the twentieth century, and in a single moment ended the era of the majestic dirigible airships.
For thirty-seven years before the Hindenburg tragedy, the gigantic airships of the Zeppelin Company captivated the world as they carried thousands of passengers on luxurious transatlantic voyages. Some dreamed that the steerable, gas-filled ""zeppelins,"" invented three years before the airplane, would fill the skies as the unrivaled way to travel over the ocean. That dream ended with the Hindenburg.
Readers of all ages will enjoy this fascinating look at the Hindenburg and the magical age of the Zeppelin airships.","[{'author_id': '58430', 'role': ''}]",2000.0,1943226,9,1643827,The Hindenburg,The Hindenburg,080506415X,9780805064155,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1312061802m/1943226.jpg

Looking at me.
These catchy stanzas frolic through the Australian author Sue Williams's simple, funny read-aloud picture book that tracks a crazy-haired boy's stroll through the countryside. The boy sees a black cat, then a brown horse, then a red cow, and so on, and before he knows it, he's being trailed by the entire menagerie! The Australian illustrator Julie Vivas brings the parade to life in lovely, lively watercolors--when the pink pig looks at the boy, for example, the boy sprays off his muddy body with a hose.

This is Michael's introduction to Skellig, the man-owl-angel who lies motionless behind the tea chests in the abandoned garage in back of the boy's dilapidated new house. As disturbing as this discovery is, it is the least of Michael's worries. The new house is a mess, his parents are distracted, and his brand-new baby sister is seriously ill. Still, he can't get this mysterious creature out of his mind--even as he wonders if he has really seen him at all. What unfolds is a powerful, cosmic, dreamlike tale reminiscent of Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time. British novelist David Almond works magic as he examines the large issues of death, life, friendship, love, and the breathtaking connections between all things.Amidst the intensity and anxiety of his world, Michael is a normal kid. He goes to school, plays soccer, and has friends with nicknames like Leakey and Coot. It's at home where his life becomes extraordinary, with the help of Skellig and Mina, the quirky, strong-willed girl next door with ""the kind of eyes you think can see right through you."" Mina and her mother's motto is William Blake's ""How can a bird that is born for joy / Sit in a cage and sing?"" This question carries us through the book, as we see Michael's baby sister trapped in a hospital incubator; as we see the exquisite, winged Skellig crumpled in the garage; as we meet Mina's precious blackbird chicks and the tawny owls in her secret attic; and as we finally see a braver, bolder Michael spread his wings and fly.

Mary Pope Osborne's Magic Tree House kids are on a pre-Camelot quest in the 31st installment -- and the third Merlin Missions book -- in the smash-hit series.
After Jack and Annie find a seashell challenging them to locate a ""shining sword"" or ""Camelot's king shall meet his doom,"" the Magic Tree House spins them off to a jagged coastline, where their harrowing journey begins. Almost immediately, a mysterious Water Knight astride a horse-fish appears and takes them to the Cave of the Spider Queen, where the duo fight tidal waves and come face to face with the arachnid herself. After escaping and meeting two seals -- who turn out to be the magician Teddy and a selkie, a human on land who becomes a seal in the water -- they dive back under the sea and eventually confront their worst battle yet: an enormous, slithering sea serpent who guards the sword. Thankfully, Jack and Annie use brain power to get past the creature and take their prize, returning it to mighty Merlin and securing Camelot.
Chock-full of suspenseful adventure as never before, Osborne's 31st tale will keep fans happily hissing for what's to come. Now that the Merlin Missions books are done, kids will be anxious to learn what magical adventures await, and, as always, they'll appreciate the author's note that adds a helpful historical perspective on the book.

But Mo and Dale start to realize that the Inn isn't the only haunted place in Tupelo Landing. People can also be haunted by their own past. As Mo and Dale handily track down the truth about the ghost (with some help from the new kid in town), they discover the truth about a great many other people, too.
A laugh out loud, ghostly, Southern mystery that can be enjoyed by readers visiting Tupelo Landing for the first time, as well as those who are old friends of Mo and Dale.","[{'author_id': '480635', 'role': ''}]",2014.0,22463128,5,25386848,The Ghosts of Tupelo Landing,The Ghosts of Tupelo Landing,1101593865,9781101593868,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1402630264m/22463128.jpg

""...A delightful tale of a brave little girl that will enthrall readers of all ages."" C. Miller
Fully Restored un-revised Illustrated edition for all ages.
As with many illustrated classic stories, it is a story with unique characters and deals with hope, determination, compassion, and much more. In the opening preface, Robert Landsbury discovers the diary in a shed on a newly purchased estate in River Falls, Ohio and passes it along to his associates. The diary is faithfully preserved for today's reader.
In it, the reader will discover that a ten-year-old mute girl, Tammy Wurtherington residing in the Wixby estate is the author. She loves to make dolls in a shed out in back of the house. She lives with Lord Wixby and Aunt May in a lavish estate at the edge of town. Aunt May teaches her to use a sewing machine and gives her a small one suited to size as a birthday gift. One day while constructing a toy soldier for her brother, Alfred the Mouse appears and is impressed with her ability to make doll outfits and reluctantly invites her to follow him to Kira if she will bring along the sewing machine.
Tammy keeps a diary of her exploits in Kira which is ruled with an iron-hand by a pair of sorceresses, Catherine and Lucinda. Tammy and Alfred find their way through a fantasy underground transportation system that ends up with the pair mistakenly ending up in a wicker-basket in the middle of the ocean. Tammy finds her voice for the first time and Alfred explains that it is a ""talking spell that allows virtually everyone to talk including the pesky (giant) flowers.""
From this point you will discover many wonderful characters like Zeke, the Flying Opossum, and Cedric the Mongoose, who accompany Tammy on her journey to Capira to present a petition to return the kingdom to its former glory. You will meet the pirate, Captain Flynn, who loves to have his guests walk the plank and the loveable Kakuna villagers who's harvest is soon to be confiscated by the royal soldiers. But please beware of the Oxboar forest, where the evil Hoarggs reside otherwise you may end up in a stew-pot.
Tammy has an adventure in which she learns to love all the strange living creatures she encounters in a magical land. Before she departs, all of Kira will fall in love with The Little Doll Girl who changed them forever and became a legend.","[{'author_id': '6037177', 'role': ''}]",2015.0,25807581,0,37812922,The Little Doll Girl,The Little Doll Girl,,,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1436024116m/25807581.jpg

Dancing distresses me.
Everything turns out wrong.
That's why, the whole day long,
I feel so gloomy.
Inspired by Ludwig Bechstein's nineteenth-century poem, Axel Scheffler has created a set of delightfully dark depictions of misanthropic misery. Julia Donaldson, Axel's collaborator on The Gruffalo, has penned a wry, witty new translation of the original German. The result is a triumph of negativity, in the macabre yet merry spirit of the late, great Edward Gorey. Superbly miserable, brilliantly curmudgeonly and oddly cheering, gloominess has never been so appealing.

Excerpt from The Adventures of a Brownie, as Told to My Child
""There was once a little Brownie who lived - where do you think he lived? - In a coal-cellar.
Now a coal-cellar may seem a most curious place to choose to live in; but then a Brownie is a curious creature - a fairy, yet not one of that sort of fairies who fly about on gossamer wings, and dance in the moonlight, and so on. He never dances; and as to wings, what use would they be to him in a coal-cellar?
He is a sober, stay-at-home, household elf-nothing much to look at, even if you did see him, which you are not likely to do-only a little old man, about a foot high, all dressed in brown, with a brown face and hands, and a brown peaked cap, just the color of a brown mouse. And, like a mouse, he hides in corners-especially kitchen corners, and only comes out after dark when nobody is about, and so sometimes people call him Mr. Nobody. I said you were not likely to see him. I never did, certainly, and never knew any body that did; but still, if you were to go into Devonshire, you would hear many funny stories about Brownies in general, and so I may as well tell you the adventures of this particular Brownie, who belonged to a family there; which family he had followed from house to house, most faithfully, for years and years.","[{'author_id': '166852', 'role': ''}, {'author_id': '3029414', 'role': 'Illustrator'}, {'author_id': '14384386', 'role': 'Illustrator'}, {'author_id': '1902980', 'role': 'Illustrator'}]",,24111895,3,1179832,The Adventures of a Brownie,The Adventures of a Brownie,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

But what was radical about this little book at the time of publication (and what makes it still compelling today) is Seuss's departure from the traditionally dull pictures and sentences used in reading primers. In contrast, the illustrations here are wild and wonderful, and the accompanying language, while simple, is delightfully silly.
For example, the rhyme ""THREE TREE/Three fish in a tree/Fish in a tree?/How can that be?"" is brought to life with a trio of plump, self-satisfied fish perched atop globular branches as two stymied hybrid dog-rabbit-humanoids look on in consternation.
'Hop on Pop' does much more than teach children the basics of word construction, it also introduces them to the incomparable pleasure of reading a book.

Review from Publishers Weekly (Nov. 3, 2014)
Keith (Mosaic Zoo: An ABC Book) wisely keeps preciousness to a minimum in this sweet-natured look at animals' devotion to their young. ""Look"" is the key word, since her striking stained glass mosaics are the book's standout feature--it's a medium that can't help but echo the ""pieces"" referenced in the title and throughout Keith's verse. Readers meet 15 parent-child animal pairs (foxes, armadillos, whales, crocodiles, and more) through variations on a repeating rhyme. "" 'I love you to pieces, you're my sweetie pie!'/ said the sheep to her lamb with a big happy sigh,"" writes Keith. In the accompanying spread, the knock-kneed younger sheep smiles adoringly at its mother, as clouds of geometric glass shapes in creams, greens, blues, and browns create their woolly coats. While there are occasional hiccups in the lilt of Keith's verse, the artistry she brings to her animal portraits--brightly colored squares on the breasts of her owl family resemble patchwork sweaters, while enamel painting gives her pigs speckled skin and faces that exude contentment--mark her as a real talent. All ages.

From book cover:
A long-distance telephone call from Chet Morton's uncle summons Frank and Joe Hardy and their staunch pal Chet to a summer art school, located near old Fort Senandaga which is reputed to be inhabited by a ghost. The young detectives' assignment: recover two famous oil paintings stolen from the valuable Prisoner-Painter collection by Jefferson Davenport.
Mr. Davenport, millionaire sponsor of Millwood Art School, reveals that one of the famous Fort Senandaga pictures painted by his artist ancestor, General Jason Davenport, contains a clue to the hiding place of a priceless chain of gold.
Vicious threats and deadly traps beset Frank, Joe, and Chet as they search for clues to the stolen paintings and the gold treasure--a search that is complicated by a stormy feud between a proud Englishman and an equally proud Frenchman over the military history of the ancient fort.
Here is a thrilling mystery-adventure guaranteed to hold the reader in breathless suspense from first page to last.","[{'author_id': '1879', 'role': ''}]",1965.0,76946,1655,2232945,"The Haunted Fort (Hardy Boys, #44)","The Haunted Fort (Hardy Boys, #44)",0448089440,9780448089447,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

en-GB,8,4.42,"From the expert team behind IT'S PERFECTLY NORMAL and IT'S SO AMAZING! comes a book for younger children about their bodies -- a resource that parents, teachers, librarians, health care providers, and clergy can use with ease and confidence.
Young children are curious about almost everything, especially their bodies. And young children are not afraid to ask questions. What makes me a girl? What makes me a boy? Why are some parts of girls' and boys' bodies the same and why are some parts different? How was I made? Where do babies come from? Is it true that a stork brings babies to mommies and daddies?
IT'S NOT THE STORK! helps answer these endless and perfectly normal questions that preschool, kindergarten, and early elementary school children ask about how they began. Through lively, comfortable language and sensitive, engaging artwork, Robie H. Harris and Michael Emberley address readers in a reassuring way, mindful of a child's healthy desire for straightforward information. Two irresistible cartoon characters, a curious bird and a squeamish bee, provide comic relief and give voice to the full range of emotions and reactions children may experience while learning about their amazing bodies. Vetted and approved by science, health, and child development experts, the information is up-to-date, age-appropriate, and scientifically accurate, and always aimed at helping kids feel proud, knowledgeable, and comfortable about their own bodies, about how they were born, and about the family they are part of.","[{'author_id': '130188', 'role': ''}, {'author_id': '236733', 'role': 'Illustrator'}]",2008.0,6325826,298,303113,"It's Not the Stork!: A Book About Girls, Boys, Babies, Bodies, Families and Friends","It's Not the Stork!: A Book About Girls, Boys, Babies, Bodies, Families and Friends",0763633313,9780763633318,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320566321m/6325826.jpg

According to tradition, the gold-bedazzled king and the miller's daughter are wed. But wait just a minute! This king is definitely not husband material, and there's someone else who is -- a hardworking guy who's supportive and nice looking, and who really comes through in a pinch.
Why not marry Rumpelstiltskin?
In Diane Stanley's merry rethinking of the traditional tale, Rumpelstiltskin and the miller's daughter are wed...and then sixteen years later their only daughter is stuck in the same dilemma: She's been locked in a room full of straw to spin for a greedy king! She could call for help from her father, but this fairy-tale heroine has some canny plans of her own.
How Rumpelstiltskin's daughter sets things to rights in the troubled kingdom, while achieving a unique place for herself, makes for a wise and witty tale of kindness and cleverness rewarded. Diane Stanley's wickedly funny text and zesty illustrations put a delightful new spin on a classic fairy tale.
Rumpelstiltskin's daughter may not be able to spin straw into gold, but she is more than a match for a monarch whose greed has blighted an entire kingdom.

An inspiring tale of a fourth-grader who fights back when her favorite book is banned from the school library--by starting her own illegal locker library!
It all started the day Amy Anne Ollinger tried to check out her favorite book in the whole world, From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, from the school library. That's when Mrs. Jones, the librarian, told her the bad news: her favorite book was banned! All because a classmate's mom thought the book wasn't appropriate for kids to read.

DO YOU KNOW THE HISTORY OF THE PUSHCART WAR? THE REALHISTORY?
It's a story of how regular people banded together and, armed with little more than their brains and good aim, defeated a mighty foe.
Not long ago the streets of New York City were smelly, smoggy, sooty, and loud. There were so many trucks making deliveries that it might take an hour for a car to travel a few blocks. People blamed the truck owners and the truck owners blamed the little wooden pushcarts that traveled the city selling everything from flowers to hot dogs. Behind closed doors the truck owners declared war on the pushcart peddlers. Carts were smashed from Chinatown to Chelsea. The peddlers didn't have money or the mayor on their side, but that didn't stop them from fighting back. They used pea shooters to blow tacks into the tires of trucks, they outwitted the police, and they marched right up to the grilles of those giant trucks and dared them to drive down their streets. Today, thanks to the ingenuity of the pushcart peddlers, the streets belong to the people--and to the pushcarts.
The Pushcart Warwas first published more than fifty years ago. It has inspired generations of children and been adapted for television, radio, and the stage around the world. It was included on School Library Journal's list of One Hundred Books That Shaped the Twentieth Century, and its assertion that a committed group of men and women can prevail against a powerful force is as relevant in the twenty-first century as it was in 1964.","[{'author_id': '79535', 'role': ''}, {'author_id': '296424', 'role': 'Illustrator'}]",2015.0,24621710,17,2092,The Pushcart War,The Pushcart War,1590179366,9781590179369,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1447709464m/24621710.jpg

About the Author
Pat Hatt can be found in the east coast of Canada. He hates writing these bio things but doesn't mind talking in the third person. He dabbles in a little of this and a little of that, not afraid to attempt something new. He is owned by two cats, one of whom has his own blog, It's Rhyme Time. Yeah a rhyming cat, who knew? He would be considered a both person when it comes to cats and dogs. He is also quite the movie and TV buff. As you can probably tell does not take himself seriously and has more stuff in his head than is needed.","[{'author_id': '6451538', 'role': ''}]",2012.0,15775002,38,21486074,Cassie and The Wild Cat: Meet and Greet,Cassie and The Wild Cat: Meet and Greet,,,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1343519543m/15775002.jpg

eng,62,4.0,"Source of legend and lyric, reference and conjecture, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is for most children pure pleasure in prose. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing ""The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new."" There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be ""curiouser and curiouser,"" seemingly without moral or sense.
For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully non-moralistic, non-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the ""regular course"" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.","[{'author_id': '8164', 'role': ''}]",2016.0,33009276,253,55548884,"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, #1)","Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, #1)",1680294644,9781680294644,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1479509898m/33009276.jpg

eng,1,3.94,"This book 'Hansel & Gretel & Other Tales' contains the stories written by the Grimm Brothers along with Rackham's imaginative, obscure and beautiful illustrations. Many of the earliest children's books, particularly those dating back to the 1900s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive. Pook Press are working to republish these classic works in affordable, high quality, colour editions, using the original text and artwork so these works can delight another generation of children. About the Authors: Jacob (1875-1863) and Wilhelm Grimm (1786-1859) were academics who spent years researching and documenting folk tales. They are arguably best known for their collection Children's and Household Tales published in 1812, which later became known as Grimm's Fairy Tales, and contained some of today's most celebrated fairy stories, such as Cinderella, Rumpelstiltskin and Hansel and Gretel. About the Illustrator: Arthur Rackham (1867-1939) was one of the premier illustrators of the early 20th Century. He illustrated many books, the first of which was published in 1893. His humour, romance and soul made him the leading illustrator of the early twentieth century and his work is to be found in versions of almost every classic from Hansel and Gretel to The Tempest, from The Pied Piper to Peer Gynt. Characteristic of his work are gloomy forests of sinuous trees, nubile fairy maidens, and unsightly ogres and trolls. Throughout his career he developed a very individual style that was to influence a whole generation of children, artists and other illustrators. His haunting humour and dreamlike romance adds to the enchantment and fantasy of children's literature.","[{'author_id': '2938140', 'role': ''}, {'author_id': '287459', 'role': 'Illustrator'}]",1985.0,21533720,1,1891298,Hansel and Gretel and Other Stories by the Brothers Grimm - Illustrated by Kay Nielsen,Hansel and Gretel and Other Stories by the Brothers Grimm - Illustrated by Kay Nielsen,1850070814,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

But being 'proper' isn't always easy - especially when you can sometimes see marvellous (as well as terrifying) things in puddles. But parlour tricks such as these are nothing compared to the world that Annabel is about to enter...
After the rather sudden departure of her mother, Annabel is sent to live with her aunts. They claim to be Shoreditch witches, and from a very old family line of them too. They're keen to introduce Annabel to their world of transformation, potions and flying broomsticks (which seem to have strong personalities of their own) but are horrified when Annabel announces not only does she not know any magic, young ladies shouldn't believe in such things. But before Annabel has time to decide whether she does or not, she is swept into an urgent quest.
The trees of Highgate have been whispering to Kitty - an extraordinary urchin of a girl, who Annabel's aunts seem very fond of - and so have the fairies. They talk of a terrible, dark magic that wants to devour all of London. And of a most magical girl who might be able to stop it . . .

From the day that they were first printed, Lang's fairy tale books of many colors have entertained thousands of youngsters, as they have also brought pleasure to the parents who have read these classics to their children.
The Grey Fairy Bookincludes many strange, exotic stories from Lithuania, Africa, Germany, Greece and France.

All in all, this collection contains 35 stories, all narrated in the lively, clear prose for which Lang was famous. Not only are Lang's generally conceded to be the best English versions of standard stories, his collections are the richest and widest in range.

eng,216,4.03,"The Tale of Squirrel Nutkinis an original classic by Beatrix Potter.
Beatrix Potter's famous tale of a naughty squirrel who loses his tail is as popular today as it was when it was first published over 100 years ago. Join Nutkin, his brother Twinkleberry and all his cousins as they make their way over to Owl Island to gather nuts. See what happens when Old Brown, the terrifying owl guardian of the island decides he has had enough of silly Nutkin's cheekiness! Ouch!!
Beatrix Potter is regarded as one of the world's best-loved children's authors of all time. From her first book, The Tale of Peter Rabbit, published by Frederick Warne in 1902, she went on to create a series of stories based around animal characters including Mrs. Tiggy-winkle, Benjamin Bunny, Jemima Puddle-duck, Mr. Jeremy Fisher and Tom Kitten.
Her humorous, lively tales and beautiful illustrations have become a natural part of childhood. With revenue from the sales of her books, Beatrix Potter bought a farm - Hill Top - in the English Lake District, where she later became a farmer and prize-winning sheep breeder. She launched the now vast merchandise programme by patenting the very first Peter Rabbit doll in 1903. The product range continues to grow today with licences around the world including baby clothing and bedding, nursery decor products and collectables. Upon her death, Beatrix Potter left 14 farms and over 4000 acres of Lake District farmland to the National Trust so that the place that she loved would remain undeveloped and protected for future generations to enjoy.
Today Beatrix Potter's original 23 tales are still published by Frederick Warne, alongside a wide range of other formats including baby books, activity books and gift and sound books.
The Tale of Squirrel Nutkinis number two in Beatrix Potter's series of 23 little books. Look out for the rest!

""Wordless... colorful... hilarious.""
Kirkus, STARRED REVIEW
In Skunk on a String, we meet a skunk who has been tied to the tail of a balloon. Try as he might, the persistent critter can't get anyone to untie him. In this wordless story, he is shooed and swatted through a bustling parade, past the windowpanes of the city's apartment buildings with their diverse, busy inhabitants, then up to the construction cranes high above the city. He floats through the zoo, into traffic, under water, and eventually lands atop a Ferris wheel. When he finally unties himself, the skunk misses the aerial life -- so he comes up with an inspired way to fly again.
Paper collage art in whimsical colors and patterns -- polka dots, gingham, and florals --creates a playful dynamic and brilliantly captures details of urban life, from the legs of a crowd to window boxes, spilled ice cream, and clothing flapping on clotheslines. This heartwarming, highly visual adventure takes a new vantage point on the ordinary and shows the skunk expanding his horizons, overcoming adversity, and, eventually, helping himself.","[{'author_id': '14173977', 'role': 'Illustrations'}]",2016.0,25943070,272,45842336,Skunk on a String,Skunk on a String,177147131X,9781771471312,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1438641821m/25943070.jpg

Lemony Snicket considers it his solemn duty to record the histoy of the hapless Baudelaires. But unless you actually enjoy listening to brilliantly written but highly disagreeable stories, you might make yourself happier simply eating a peach.

If you liked reading it, which I'm sure you will, don't miss ""The Immovable Rock"", ""The Fishing Derby"", or ""Foggy Daze"".
Ideal for a bedtime read.
If you like this one, other stories like 'Cross Your Fingers', 'Everyone has a Name', 'Gingersnap Dragons', 'Foggy Daze', or 'Sick Again' you will find great for family laughs.
Alternatively, I have several fully illustrated stories, like 'Monsters I Know', 'Kids I Know, 'Hector the Collector', or 'Marmalade Jam and Chocolate Eclairs', and others
My stories are designed for both the reader and the listener.
Children will request parents to re-read, over and over again, a story that has caught their imagination.
If not in rhyme, these stories will quickly become dull and a burden to read.
When written in free verse, a story is both a delight to read and to hear.
The reader feels accomplished when reading my stories and, in the act of story telling, begins exaggerating tone, inflection, and mood.
When constructed in free verse rhyme, while reading along, children quickly begin to retain portions of each story.
Once the child begins reading independently, these stories act as memory assisting templates to guide the beginning reader through their first reading selections. The reading successes of a child will fuel additional comprehension activities and help to jump start reading skills that greatly motivate the young reader.
For the adult reader these stories are always a treat.
I understand the necessity to include a readers interests and needs as part of the story telling activities.
The length of these stories is designed to be between 10 to 15 minutes, to act as a short break or bedtime activity. Unlike Dr. Suess, I have avoided making up new nouns and adjectives for purposes of rhyme,
other than some tintinnabulation (words designed to give greater description of sounds), finding that teachers do not appreciate this activity.
I find that by identifying children by full name, as the story characters, it adds a sense of character reality and identity. The children accept the diversity of people, which, in turn, opens the imagination to accepting limitless fictional situations and opportunities.
My stories constitute several conceptual elements to motivate reading and precipitate a positive child's reading development.
For all teachers and Friends, I applaud your support in exposing free verse reading to young children. Your efforts to improve early perceptions of reading will provide children with a foundation for continued learning comprehension and development.","[{'author_id': '6536176', 'role': ''}]",,18873256,12,26873166,THE VERY LAST APPLE,THE VERY LAST APPLE,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

Thus begins the rhyming story of Jim Alexander, whose nickname was Gimme-Jimmy because he was a greedy and selfish bully. Imagine Jimmy's concern when he found that every time he said the word ""Gimme,"" his hand grew larger! Jimmy was happy to discover that when he was polite and said, ""Please"" and ""Thank you,"" his hand began to shrink. He started practicing his new ""Polite Rule"" and found out that it was much more fun to share. Author Sherrill S. Cannon wrote three children's books that garnered prestigious awards in 2011. In less than two years, this award-winning grandmother of nine had three books and five children's plays published. Gimme-Jimmy is her fourth book. Her earlier book The Magic Word received a Readers Favorite Gold Medal, a NABE Pinnacle Achievement Award and a Global eBook Finalist Award; Santa's Birthday Gift received a National Indie Excellence Finalist Award and a Readers Favorite Silver Medal; and Peter and the Whimper-Whineys won a Readers Favorite Bronze Medal and a USA Best Books Finalist Award.

Erik and Emma, two young marsupials, and Devon, an orphaned red fox, are on their own personal quests; two to save a life, one to destroy another. When their paths cross, these natural enemies forge an unusual friendship. Soon they hear of the devastation caused by the evil king and they realize that their personal objectives must be put aside. Even though that decision will affect their own lives, and the lives of the ones they love, they are determined to help their fellow creatures. They put themselves at risk by joining a motley crew of animals, whose main objective is to end the reign of King Cynric.
A final battle will take place in the shadow of Fortress Demelza as the king's forces clash with this rag tag band of creatures from the countryside. The fate of Sunderland and its inhabitants is at stake.

Papa gets a haircut, makes repairs to the house, and hides a lucky coin for Maomao to find. Which she does! But all too soon it is time for Papa to go away again. This poignant, vibrantly illustrated tale, which won the prestigious Feng Zikai Chinese Children's Picture Book Award in 2009, is sure to resonate with every child who misses relatives when they are away and shows how a family's love is strong enough to endure over time and distance.

If words make up the stories and letters make up the words, then stories are made up of letters. In this menagerie we have stories made of words, made FOR all the letters.
The most inventive and irresistible book of the year spans a mere 26 letters (don't they all!) and 112 pages. From an Astronaut who's afraid of heights, to a Bridge that ends up burned between friends, to a Cup stuck in a cupboard and longing for freedom, Once Upon an Alphabetis a creative tour de force from A through Z. Slyly funny in a way kids can't resist, and gorgeously illustrated in a way readers of all ages will pour over, this series of interconnected stories and characters explores the alphabet in a way that will forever raise the bar.
In Once Upon an Alphabet, #1 New York Times bestseller Oliver Jeffers has created a stunning collection of words and artwork that is a story book, alphabet book, and gorgeously designed art book all in one.
Praise for ONCE UPON AN ALPHABET:
* ""The silly, spare, slightly surreal text occasionally rhymes and endlessly surprises. An utterly delightful alphabet book.""-Kirkus Review, starred review
* ""An altogether stimulating, surprising, and satisfying reading experience.""-School Library Journal, starred review

eng,10,4.24,"Beautifully illustrated in two distinct styles, this book introduces readers to a Zen approach to the world, wrapped in a story about three siblings and their new neighbor, a panda. One by one, the children visit Stillwater, enjoying his company and listening to him tell a brief tale that illustrates a Zen principle. Each time, there is a link between the conversation shared by Stillwater and his visitor and the story he tells; it's somewhat tenuous in regard to the two older siblings, quite specific in the case of Karl, the youngest. The tales invite the children to consider the world and their perceptions from a different angle; for Karl, the panda's story gently but pointedly teaches the benefits of forgiveness. Richly toned and nicely detailed watercolors depict the ""real world"" scenes, while those accompanying the Zen lessons employ black lines and strokes on pastel pages to create an interesting blend of Western realism and more evocative Japanese naturalism. Taken simply as a picture book, Zen Shorts is interesting and visually lovely. As an introduction to Zen, it is a real treat, employing familiar imagery to prod children to approach life and its circumstances in profoundly ""un-Western"" ways. An author's note discusses the basic concept of Zen and details the sources of Stillwater's stories. Appealing enough for a group read-aloud, but also begging to be shared and discussed by caregiver and child, Zen Shorts is a notable achievement.","[{'author_id': '12733', 'role': ''}]",2005.0,162474,64,2015914,Zen Shorts,Zen Shorts,0439789230,9780439789233,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

Fifth grader Slater Hannigan wants to keep his big man on campus status.

Everyone thinks that Sophie is an orphan. True, there were no other recorded female survivors from the shipwreck that left baby Sophie floating in the English Channel in a cello case, but Sophie remembers seeing her mother wave for help. Her guardian tells her it is almost impossible that her mother is still alive--but ""almost impossible"" means ""still possible."" And you should never ignore a possible.
So when the Welfare Agency writes to her guardian, threatening to send Sophie to an orphanage, she takes matters into her own hands and flees to Paris to look for her mother, starting with the only clue she has-- the address of the cello maker.
Evading the French authorities, she meets Matteo and his network of rooftoppers--urchins who live in the hidden spaces above the city. Together they scour the city in a search for Sophie's mother--but can they find her before Sophie is caught and sent back to London? Or, more importantly, before she loses hope?

Rather than simply retelling portions of the Bible, this book presents the big picture--the unified story running through the Old and New Testaments. Twenty-six stories together form parts of this big picture.
Simply written and beautifully illustrated, this book teaches children the Bible's whole story so they can begin to appreciate the fulfillment of God's promise to his people. The Big Picture Story Bible is perfect for parents to read to their children and for older children to read on their own.
First published in 2004, The Big Picture Story Bible has been widely praised and used by parents. It now comes with an audio recording of the book, read by the author and presented on two CDs, one each for the Old and New Testaments. Great for Sunday school classes and trips in the car, children can listen to the text and follow along in the book.

eng,1,4.17,"The Tale of Peter Rabbit is a children's book written & illustrated by Beatrix Potter. The story follows Peter Rabbit, a disobediently mischievous young rabbit, as he ventures into the garden of Mr. McGregor. The tale was written for 5-year-old Noel Moore in 1893, revised, privately printed by Potter in 1901 after several publishers' rejections & printed in a trade edition by Frederick Warne & Co. in 1902. Multiple reprints were issued in years immediately following.
Warne's NY office failed to register copyright for the tale in the USA. Consequently, unlicensed copies flooded the market from which Potter received no royalties. Peter Rabbit has been translated into 36 languages & has generated considerable merchandise over the decades since its release for both children & adults with toys, dishes, foods, clothing, videos & other products. Potter was one of the 1st to be responsible for such merchandise when she patented a Peter Rabbit doll in 1903 & followed it almost immediately with a Peter Rabbit board game. By making the hero of the tale a disobediently rebellious rabbit, Potter subverted her era's definition of the good child & the literary hero genre which typically followed the adventures of bravely resourceful, young white males.
Peter, his sisters Flopsy, Mopsy & Cottontail, & his mother are anthropomorphic characters dressed in human clothing & generally walking upright. Peter is a young rabbit whose mother has forbidden him & his sisters to enter the garden of Mr. McGregor. It was there that their father met his untimely end to became a pie ingredient. When Mrs. Rabbit hurries off on an errand, Peter cannot resist the temptation to enter the garden. There, he gorges on vegetables until he gets sick. Then he's chased about by McGregor. When Peter loses his jacket & his shoes, McGregor uses them to dress a scarecrow. After several close encounters, Peter escapes the garden & returns to his mother exhausted & ill. She puts him to bed with a dose of camomile tea while his sisters (who've been good little bunnies) enjoy bread, milk & blackberries for supper.","[{'author_id': '11593', 'role': ''}]",1902.0,7395758,35,644171,The Tale of Peter Rabbit,The Tale of Peter Rabbit,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

But it will take the two girls working together, along with a mighty dollop of self-confidence--and some very messy hands--to accomplish the extraordinary.","[{'author_id': '3162', 'role': ''}, {'author_id': '104017', 'role': 'Illustrations'}]",2016.0,25785835,797,45636487,Bloom,Bloom,1442406208,9781442406209,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1454864009m/25785835.jpg

Each member of The Community has their profession carefully chosen for them by the Committee of Elders, and they never make a mistake.

Before you throw this awful book to the ground and run as far away from it as possible, you should probably know why. This book is the only one which describes every last detail of the Baudelaire children's miserable stay at Heimlich Hospital, which makes it one of the most dreadful books in the world.
There are many pleasant things to read about, but this book contains none of them. Within the pages are such burdensome details as a suspicious shopkeeper, unnecessary surgery, an intercom system, anesthesia, heart-shaped ballons, and some very startling news about a fire. Clearly you do not want to read about such things.

Aesop's Fables or Aesopica refers to a collection of fables credited to Aesop (620-560 BC), a slave and story-teller who lived in Ancient Greece. Aesop's Fables have become a blanket term for collections of brief fables, usually involving anthropomorphic animals. His fables are some of the most well known in the world. The fables remain a popular choice for moral education of children today. Many stories included in Aesop's Fables, such as The Fox and the Grapes (from which the idiom ""sour grapes"" was derived), The Tortoise and the Hare, The North Wind and the Sun and The Boy Who Cried Wolf, are well-known throughout the world.","[{'author_id': '12452', 'role': ''}, {'author_id': '69163', 'role': 'Illustrator'}, {'author_id': '7014283', 'role': 'Introduction'}, {'author_id': '1357336', 'role': 'Translator'}]",,20947401,9,868263,Aesop's Fables,Aesop's Fables,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

The books follow Peter Hatcher, his little brother Fudgie, baby sister Tootsie, their neighbor Sheila Tubman, various pets, and minor characters through New York City and on treks to suburbs and camps. Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothingis the first of these entertaining yarns. Peter, because he's the oldest, must deal with Fudgie's disgusting cuteness, his constant meddling with Peter's stuff, and other grave offenses, one of which is almost too much to bear. All these incidents are presented with the unfailing ear and big-hearted humor of the masterful Judy Blume. Though some of her books for older kids have aroused controversy, the Hatcher brothers and their adventures remain above the fray, where they belong. (Peter's in fourth grade, so the book is suitable for kids ages 8 and older.)","[{'author_id': '12942', 'role': ''}]",2001.0,820082,44,879886,Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing,Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing,0330398172,9780330398176,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

Eleven-year-old Marty Preston loves to spend time up in the hills behind his home near Friendly, West Virginia. Sometimes he takes his .22 rifle to shoot cans from the rail fence. Other times he goes up early in the morning just to sit and watch the fox and deer.
But one summer Sunday, Marty comes across something different on the road just past the old Shiloh schoolhouse---a young beagle---and that's when the trouble begins.
What do you do when a dog you suspect is being mistreated runs away and comes to you? When the man who owns the dog has a gun? This is Marty's problem, and it is one he will have to face alone. Soon Marty will have to put his courage on the line, discovering in the process that it is not always easy to separate right from wrong. Sometimes, however, a boy will do almost anything to save a dog.

where there may be low-lying fog,
to see if you can meet the beast from the Far East!
Frog Meets a Bog Beast is a delightful tale with a twist, combining beautiful images with a rhyming swing. This first printed book in the 'My Animal Puzzle Book Series' sets the scene for a collection of thoughtful, entertaining stories.
Bog life was simple but never dull for Frog. It was home sweet home with lots of moss and Frog was boss. It was never busy or ever smelt fishy. Frog loved his own company, licking flies from the skies or hunting in the ground where worms, beetles or slugs could all be found. Every day, Frog collected these delicious 'sweet' treats to eat from the peat. Lots of flavour to savour!
Being green and so unseen gave him a great hiding or canopy screen. But a bizarre creature with odd features made Frog freeze at the knees! Frog decided to be brave, though the outcome could be grave. Keeping still was not Frog's free will and it really felt no thrill. Was this creature real and should Frog be in fear..?
With words and pictures that can be enjoyed both visually and audibly, this short story encourages communication skills and courage together with a theme of friendship. It is more than a picture book! A mini 'Bog Field Guide' and 'How To Make Your Own Frog' craft activity are also included. Suitable for adult supported reading, early readers and children aged 4-8, it raises thoughts on courage, friendship, nature and exploring different environments.","[{'author_id': '8181337', 'role': ''}]",2014.0,22019660,7,41336024,Frog Meets a Bog Beast,Frog Meets a Bog Beast,,9781783065738,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1398934371m/22019660.jpg

And so begins a grand life of adventure with her trusty riding quail, Mumfrey...until her twelfth birthday arrives and the curse manifests in a most unexpected way.

Defying drowsiness to the last, he finally falls asleep, clutching his stuffed bunny tightly under his wing. Set against comfortably faded pastel backgrounds, the cartoon artwork focuses tightly on the main character, with his comments presented in dialogue balloons.

His island has lots to keep him occupied: beautiful beaches to play on, the warm sea to swim in and ponds to go ice skating on in the winter. However, life on the island can be lonely. Lots of ships pass by his island, but none ever stop to pay him a visit, which makes Plonk very sad.
Life takes a turn for the worse when he is captured by a wicked witch and becomes her servant. Managing to escape, he is then promptly captured by a pony-man, who makes him give rides to children on the beach.
As he runs away again, Plonk meets a friendly gnome, who tells him how to find the Good Fairy, who will help him home. Before he knows it, he is on the Good Fairy's magical boat, sailing back to his island.
Finally safe again, he resumes his quiet life, but cannot help but feel lonely still. But Plonk's life changes when the Good Fairy pays him a final visit, bringing him a very special gift...

Grandad is the boy's best friend. Being with him always makes the world seem right. And how vast that world is. A world of tall trees that reach for the clouds and sun and moon and stars--and what else is reaching for heaven but a prayer?

Finally, the boy asks the hardest question of all: ""Are our prayers answered, Grandad?""
And, one day, long after Grandad is gone, after many, many prayers, after the boy is grown, he understands Grandad's reply: ""Most prayers are not really questions. And if we listen very closely, a prayer is often its own answer.""

Neill, it is significant that no one from Oz appears in the book until its climax; this is due to Baum having originally written most of the book as an original fantasy novel over ten years earlier, in 1905. Most of the action takes place on three islands -- Pingaree, Regos, and Coregos -- and within the Nome King's caverns. Since the original ruler of the nomes, Roquat -- who later re-named himself Ruggedo, was deposed in 1914's Tik-Tok of Oz, Baum had to cleverly rework the tale to accommodate his selfish but well-intentioned replacement, Kaliko.

eng,6,3.94,"The most unusual baseball facts you'll ever find!
Referred to as ""America's National Pastime,"" and ""The Greatest Sport on Earth,"" baseball has captured the hearts and imaginations of millions of people.
Behind the game lies a wealth of science, folklore, mathematics, psychology--and a very colorful past. Whether they are die-hard fans or casual spectators, readers will be captivated by this collection of fascinating, little-known facts. For example did you know that the yarn in a single baseball is long enough to reach from the street to the top of the Empire State Building or that in the old days playoff tickets were sold for people to stand in the outfield: fans might move to help the home team but not budge an inch for opposing players.
With lots of humorous, colorful illustrations, charts, and graphs, Baseballogy explores such diverse topics as the materials used to make the balls (including fish eyes, once used for the core!), freak injuries (one player was stabbed by a bat!), and the chances of making it to ""the show"" (1 in about 14,000 baseball playing kids will get to the big leagues).
For real baseball aficionados, there's a section on the physics of hitting the ball, a look at some long-standing records they might not have known about, and explanations of the numbers on baseball cards, play-by-plays, and even the players' shirts. A Baseball Trivia Quiz at the end of the book lets kids test their knowledge with questions like, ""What does OPS mean?"" and ""What are the seven ways a hitter can make it to home base?""

eng,22,3.98,"""Believe me, my young friend, there is nothing--absolutely nothing--half so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats.""--the Water Rat to the Mole
An instant bestseller upon its initial publication in 1908, The Wind in the Willowshas become one of the beloved stories of all time. How could Ratty and Mole have known when they took to the river over one hundred years ago that they would begin a phenomenon that would produce one of the most oft-quoted lines in British literature, and inspire everyone from the creator of Winnie-the-Pooh to Pink Floyd? Drawing from more than a decade of research, Annie Gauger, one of the world's leading experts on Kenneth Grahame and The Wind in the Willows, now presents a fascinating new annotated edition that reintroduces readers to Otter, curmudgeonly Badger, and rollicking, boastful Toad, while revealing the secrets behind this treasured classic.
In The Annotated Wind in the Willows, readers will discover the sheer joy of the original text, restored to the original 1908 version, illustrated with hundreds of full-color images--including the beloved drawings by E. H. Shepard and Arthur Rackham. This edition also includes Shepard's famous map of the Wild Wood and rarely seen images by illustrators Graham Robertson, Paul Bransom, Nancy Barnhart, and Wyndham Payne.
In an illuminating preface, Gauger explains how Grahame came to write the novel, which began as a bedtime story and then became a series of letters he wrote to his son, Alastair. This edition reproduces the original letters in their entirety and includes nearly a thousand delightful annotations on everything from automobiles (Toad drove an Armstrong Hardcastle Special Eight) and early motorcar etiquette to modern manifestations (Disneyland's Mr. Toad's Wild Ride). She reveals how William John Cavendish Bentinck-Scott, the peculiar Fifth Duke of Portland, built an extensive network of underground tunnels, thus inspiring the character of Badger, and she puts Grahame's work in literary context, comparing him to Dickens, Rudyard Kipling, A. A. Milne, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Finally, new to this edition, long buried in the Kenneth Grahame papers, are the notes, letters, and writings by Alastair Grahame and his governess, including several pieces by Kenneth Grahame himself that have never been published before.
With a stunning, lyrical tribute to Grahame by Brian Jacques, the internationally best-selling author of the Redwallseries, The Annotated Wind in the Willowsshould prove a most beautiful and enduring tribute to Grahame's masterpiece.","[{'author_id': '3843', 'role': ''}, {'author_id': '5329', 'role': 'Introduction'}, {'author_id': '2764146', 'role': 'Editor'}]",2009.0,6047858,287,1061285,The Annotated Wind in the Willows,The Annotated Wind in the Willows,0393057747,9780393057744,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

This first book in the series contains a collection of nineteen individual stories where, in spite of trying to be good, Nicholas and his friends always seem to end up in some kind of mischief. Whether in the school room, at home, or in the playground, their exuberance often takes over and the results are calamitous - at least for their teachers and parents. Whether confusing the photographer hired to take the class picture, dealing with having to wear glasses for the first time, or trying desperately to help the teacher when the school inspector pays a visit, Nicholas always manages to make matters worse.","[{'author_id': '1041311', 'role': ''}, {'author_id': '42102', 'role': 'Illustrator'}, {'author_id': '25355', 'role': 'Translator'}]",,128654,326,123908,Nicholas,Nicholas,0714845299,9780714845296,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

Miss Blackwell had no real friends to speak of when she were alive so she had to make ones out of her own imagination. The problem was no one else could see them. With Martin's Book of the Occult, though, that was a problem of the past. There just so happened to be a spell capable making her friends visible to the rest of the world.

eng,4,4.0,"Source of legend and lyric, reference and conjecture, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is for most children pure pleasure in prose. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing ""The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new."" There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be ""curiouser and curiouser,"" seemingly without moral or sense.
For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully non-moralistic, non-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the ""regular course"" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.","[{'author_id': '8164', 'role': ''}]",1993.0,6252402,32,55548884,Alice in Wonderland,Alice in Wonderland,0261660683,9780261660687,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

In this colorful picture book, a boy named Marco goes fishing in a small pond called McElligot's Pool. As he sits waiting for a bite, a farmer calls him a fool and says ""You'll never catch fish in McElligot's Pool!"" Marco, however, refuses to be discouraged and spends the rest of the story describing all the fish that could be coming to McElligot's Pool from the ocean. The story ends with Marco still fishing and the farmer scratching his beard and looking confused. The use of color and illustrations blur the line between fantasy and reality during Marco's story, creating one of the most interesting aspects of the book. The text is made up of catchy rhymes and intriguing fish descriptions. The pictures complement the text and make the fish descriptions seem real. Interestingly, Seuss illustrates every other page in black and white. At the beginning of the story when Marco sits by the pond, the black and white emphasizes the concrete reality of the Marco talking to the farmer. After page one, every other page is in color. The color magnifies Marco's fantasy about all of the fish, making them seem beautiful and real. At the same time, the black and white pages make Marco's fish descriptions seem realistic. Seuss's use of the black-and-white pictures during Marco's whimsical descriptions in the text could be his way of toning down the fantasy and bringing it into the context of every day life. The use of color to blend reality and fantasy also emphasizes optimism in the story. The farmer was probably right in telling Marco that he will ""never catch fish in McElligot's Pool."" With the clever use of color and illustrations, however, Dr. Seuss undermines the fisherman's certainty and makesMarco's claim that there might be fish in McElligot's Pool believable.

One lazy, hot afternoon, Alice grows bored sitting by the riverbank and follows a mysterious white rabbit. Following it down a rabbit hole, Alice tumbles into a magical nonsense world where meeting a Mad Hatter and disappearing Cheshire Cat are just part of the adventure. In a strange land of talking doorknobs and magical potions, Alice wonders if she will ever find her way home.

During the few months he lives on the streets, Latif learns more life lessons than he would have done with many years of education. He experiences harsh living conditions, discrimination and humiliation. At this young age, he has a lot of confusion and cannot figure out what is wrong with a system that sanctions such a life for children. The experiences by five of his friends add more depth to the story. Latif's fragile soul almost crashes witnessing elements of poverty and helplessness and observing that no matter how hard his father and many others try, they still remain poor and powerless.
At the beginning the writer, Samad Behrangi, gives a detailed description of the material world surrounding his hero, the behaviors, conversations and conducts of all players, as he believes the material environment plays a major role in building up the characters of the people. But as soon as the story kicks off, it moves forward with a fast pace of the power and strength of life itself, taking the reader along with it.
Readers meet people of different social strata, with voices of each adding depth and excellent character development.
Latif spends a great deal of time outside a toy store wishing to have toys to play with and has a fascination about one particular camel who later becomes his mentor and takes him on an imaginary tour to see the other side of the society, gives him awareness as to how the system functions.
The real awakening however, is more of a wake-up call.

Within the chapters of this story, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire encounter a darkened staircase, a red herring, some friends in a dire situation, three mysterious initials, a liar with an evil scheme, a secret passageway, and parsley soda.
I have sworn to write down these tales of the Baudelaire orphans so the general public will know each terrible thing that has happened to them, but if you decide to read something else instead, you will save yourself from a heapful of horror and woe.
With all due respect,

Henry is a very particular sort of pig. ""A place for everything and everything in its place,"" he always says. But when he looks out his window he is troubled. The farm is a mess! Henry is worried that nobody will be able to find anything in this mess. So he draws a map showing all the animals exactly where they belong. And Henry embarks on a journey through the farm, his friends tagging along as he creates his map: sheep in the woolshed, chickens in the coop, the horse in the stable. After the map is complete, Henry uses it to bring himself back home, where he is relieved to know that he is exactly where he belongs. A place for everything and everything in its place, indeed.
For fans of Zen Shortsby Jon J. Muth or of Winnie the Pooh, this sweet romp through the farm is adorably illustrated by David Elliot, who created the endearing animals who inhabit Brian Jacques world of Redwall. Perfect for pre-schoolers and elemetary-schoolers learning to read maps for the first time.

In early 2017, Senator Elizabeth Warren's refusal to be silenced in the Senate inspired a spontaneous celebration of women who persevered in the face of adversity.

* Why did God allow the Israelites to kill people?
* Why did God create us?

So thought Roald Dahl in 1924 when his plan to get revenge on the mean and disgusting candy-store owner Mrs. Pratchett seemed to have worked all too well. Writing about this and other boyhood adventures, the author has recalled only those that stand out as spectacular. ""Some are funny. Some are painful. Some are unpleasant. I suppose that is why I have always remembered them so vividly. All are true.""
We are told of his first automobile ride, in which he nearly lost his nose; of the canings by Headmasters and older schoolboys; and of the grisly methods of Matrons, those guardians against misbehavior who supervised the dormitories. There were glorious times, too, with his big family at home in Wales; on holiday each summer on a remote island in Norway; and in the class of an endearing math teacher who thought numbers the dreariest things in the world.
Roald Dahl's adventures and misadventures during his school years are crowded with people as strange and wonderful as any character he has created and are as exciting and full of the unexpected as his celebrated fiction.

This delightful compilation includes all fifteen books written by L. Frank Baum:
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz
The Marvelous Land of Oz
Ozma of Oz
Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz
The Road to Oz
The Emerald City of Oz
The Patchwork Girl Of Oz
Little Wizard Stories of Oz
Tik-Tok of Oz
The Scarecrow Of Oz
Rinkitink In Oz
The Lost Princess Of Oz
The Tin Woodman Of Oz
The Magic of Oz
Glinda Of Oz
Perhaps there is no better, or fitting, introduction one could give to this compilation than the author's note that Baum himself writes in his very first book, ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz."" Here he reveals the true intention of his work. Folklore, legends, myths and fairy tales have followed childhood through the ages, for every healthy youngster has a wholesome and instinctive love for stories fantastic, marvelous and manifestly unreal. The winged fairies of Grimm and Andersen have brought more happiness to childish hearts than all other human creations. Yet the old time fairy tale, having served for generations, may now be classed as ""historical"" in the children's library; for the time has come for a series of newer ""wonder tales"" in which the stereotyped genie, dwarf and fairy are eliminated, together with all the horrible and blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a fearsome moral to each tale. Modern education includes morality; therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident. Having this thought in mind, the story of ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" was written solely to please children of today. It aspires to being a modernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heartaches and nightmares are left out.","[{'author_id': '3242', 'role': ''}, {'author_id': '5804248', 'role': 'Illustrator'}]",,18634109,2377,42904182,Oz: The Complete Collection,Oz: The Complete Collection,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

It was a happy arrangement for both the real mother and the make-believe one, but over the years babysitting became a professional business and one for older girls only. Carol Ryrie Brink is convinced that there are just as many little girls who love babies as there ever were, and it is especially for them that she has written this humorous and imaginative storybook adventure.
The story opens with 12-year-old Mary Wallace and her younger sister about to abandon a sinking ocean liner. They find themselves in a lifeboat adrift on the Pacific Ocean--alone, except for four very lively babies left in their charge!
The boat takes them to a tiny tropical island where they build a shelter, find food, acquire a fifth baby--a monkey--and, except for a few near tragedies, have a grand adventure bringing up the babies in native style. How they manage to win the friendship of the island's only other inhabitant--a confirmed child-hating Englishman--is just one of many amusing developments in this appealing story.","[{'author_id': '5325', 'role': ''}, {'author_id': '867185', 'role': 'Illustrator'}]",1966.0,16114578,14,84,Baby Island,Baby Island,,,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1351458238m/16114578.jpg

eng,71,4.04,"While the Wright Brothers were glidingover Kitty Hawk, the charming Brazilian Alberto Santos-Dumont was making his own mark on the history of flight.
Alberto loved floating over Paris in his personal flying machine called a dirigible. He would tie it to a post, climb down, and spend the day shopping or meeting friends for coffee. But he wanted to make his invention even better. By 1906, Alberto had transformed his balloon into a box with wings! But now there was competition. Another inventor challenged Alberto to see who would be the first in flight. Alberto's hard work paid off, and his airplane successfully soared into the air, making him the first pilot to lift off and land a completely self-propelled plane.
The book includes an author's note about Santos-Dumont, a bibliography, an index, and photographs of his flying machines.
Praise for Fabulous Flying Machines of Alberto Santos-Dumont
""At the turn of the last century, all sorts of ambitious and eccentric men were competing furiously to get the first airplane into the sky. One of the most famous of these was a dashing Brazilian who lived in Paris and, to wide admiration, did his errands by airship. Victoria Griffith tells his story...which is illustrated with panache in rich, smudgy oils and pastelsby Italian artist Eva Montanari."" -Wall Street Journal
""An excellent read-aloud, this picture book is a must when studying the history of flight and can be used as a resource for research, a book for all your reading needs!"" -Library Media Connection
""Montanari's chalky illustrations are distinguished by a strong sense of motion, and the story's suspense (rival pilots! harrowing landings!) and surprise cameos (Louis Cartier!) make this an elegant tribute to a hero of early aviation."" -Publishers Weekly
""Strong vertical trim and layout, which one would expect to exploit sweeping skyscapes, are instead cleverly deployed to put viewers among the earthbound spectators, most often glimpsing the aviator in the distance. A bibliography and brief index round out the title, which will be a first choice for aviation enthusiasts."" -The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books
""A generous spirit and penchant for grand gestures make him [Santos-Dumont] all the more worth knowing--particularly for American audiences unaware that there is any question about who was the first to fly. -Kirkus Reviews
""Montanari captures the look, dress, and formality of the era in her splendid, impressionistic pastel, chalk, and oil paintings. The endnotes add details and facts about the life of this charismatic, adventurous man and mark his place in aviation history."" -School Library Journal
""Even if you've never heard of Santos-Dumont, you'll be delighted to meet this real-life historical figure in Victoria Griffith's vivid debut picture book. This fine picture book resurrects his story in lively prose and large-scale illustrations rendered in pastels, chalks, oil pastels and oil paint, perfectly capturing the drama of the events. The fuzzy lines lend a feeling of history to the illustrations, and gestures and humorous touches, such as a dog holding the dirigible's tether or Alberto racing horse-drawn carriages, make Alberto Santos-Dumont and his times come alive."" -BookPage","[{'author_id': '579575', 'role': ''}, {'author_id': '163749', 'role': ''}]",2011.0,11689243,182,16635831,The Fabulous Flying Machines of Alberto Santos-Dumont,The Fabulous Flying Machines of Alberto Santos-Dumont,1419700111,9781419700118,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1307892994m/11689243.jpg

eng,33,3.89,"The Barnes & Noble Review
Author Kathryn Lasky lays the groundwork for an owlish tale of good versus evil in this first adventurous installment of Guardians of Ga'Hoole.
After little Soren, a barn owl, finds himself pushed out of Mum and Da's nest, he's captured by two ruthless hench-birds and taken to the St. Aegolius Academy for Orphaned Owls. Now a mere owl slave to rulers seeking domination over all owl kingdoms, Soren is given a number and finds himself working in the Pelletorium, where brainwashed (""moon blinked"") owls sort through stones for ""flecks."" Fortunately, Soren has an elf owl friend to help him get by, and the two begin clandestine flying lessons in the lair's library. Luckily, they narrowly escape a bloody battle, and with help from two more owl pals, Soren and Gylfie realize their mission to find the Great Tree of Ga'Hoole, warn its guardians of St. Aggie's plans, and ""become part of this ancient kingdom of knights on silent wings that rose in the blackness to perform deeds of greatness.""
With all the right elements -- a hero that's destined for greatness and the struggle between light and darkness -- Lasky's Guardians debut is a high-flying hoot. Soren's tale is suspenseful and riveting, and by the book's end, readers will even be impressed with how much they've learned about owls. Reminiscent of Brian Jacques's Redwall and Robin Jarvis's Deptford Mice, The Captureis bound to catch fantasy fans in its talons.

Gr 4 Up-Saint-Exupery's little prince, interplanetary traveler and ingenuous seeker of that which is most important in life, returns in an elegant pop-up edition with unabridged text. The original artwork has been repositioned and redesigned to incorporate movable sculptures, turning wheels, and other visual effects. Almost every spread features an illustration, each carefully placed to add to the story's pacing and augment its impact. For example, readers' first glimpse of the little prince's tiny planet is dramatically presented via an illustration that spins upright as the page is turned. The boy's recounting of his relationship with his beloved yet vexing flower is made more immediate through a series of sequenced flaps, each harboring a tiny pop-up image. A towering 3-D depiction of the protagonist posed atop a mountain peak underscores his sense of loneliness. Delineated with a delicate touch, the paper engineering adds a new dimension to this wistful fairy tale without overpowering it, enhancing the story's subtleties and echoing its sense of wonder.-Joy Fleishhacker, School Library Journal Copyright 2010 Reed Business Information.","[{'author_id': '1020792', 'role': ''}, {'author_id': '27112', 'role': 'Translator'}]",2004.0,849778,138,2180358,The Little Prince,The Little Prince,1405216344,9781405216340,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1332660391m/849778.jpg
